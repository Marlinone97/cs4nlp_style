Looking back, results are still trickling in from the election night more than two weeks ago. It now looks like Democrats may have gained as many as 40 seats in the House of Representatives. Looking ahead, they are fighting over who will be speaker, with Nancy Pelosi appearing to gain support. At a taping of ""The Axe Files"" podcast, President Obama expressed confidence in her leadership.', 'I think Nancy Pelosi, when the history is written, will go down as one of the most effective legislative leaders that we - this country has ever seen.', ""And down south at the Mar-a-Lago estate, the current president, Trump, has been attacking some of his favorite targets - the 9th Circuit Appeals Court, Hillary Clinton - but not the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. This week, Trump said there won't be consequences for the killing last month of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. When a reporter asked yesterday who should be held accountable, here's what Trump said."", ""Maybe the world should be held accountable because the world's a vicious place. The world is a very, very vicious place."", ""To discuss this and more from the week in politics, columnist Gayle Trotter of the Right In DC blog and the Boston Herald's Kimberly Atkins are here with us. Welcome to both of you."", 'Great to be with you.', 'Hi there.', ""Let's start with President Trump and his decision not to punish the Saudi crown prince, even though the CIA assess that Mohammed bin Salman approved the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Trump said he doesn't want to jeopardize weapons deals with the Saudis. Some analysts have said this will give a green light to autocrats that they can buy America's silence if they purchase enough weapons. Kimberly, do you think that's an accurate assessment?"", ""I think it is. I think it's a really big problem moving forward with this president in the face of what seems to be a clear, horrific civil - human rights violation to not stand up and say this is not going to be tolerated. And it's putting him at odds even with some members of his own party in Congress who really want to see action, some sanctions, really pulling out of these arms deals, something that will send a message that the freedom of the press is important and the United States won't give a green light to this kind of activity."", 'Gayle, do you think the president misjudged this?', ""Well, geopolitical alliances are fraught with difficult trade-offs. And I think that obviously this murder was brutal and horrific, but it's unclear whether this is going to affect the United States' alliance with Saudi Arabia. There's certainly a political strain on the relationship, but it's not just about the sale of weapons. It's about the balance of power in the Middle East. And when you contrast Saudi Arabia's position with Iran's position, certainly there's an understanding that America needs to make sure that Iran is not able to run roughshod over the entire Middle East. So it's - there is much more involved in this calculation than just arms sales."", ""We're seeing that Saudi Arabia-Iran tension play out in Yemen..."", 'Yes.', ""...Which is where Saudi Arabia is using many of those weapons that the Saudis buy from the U.S. On Morning Edition today, David Miliband of the International Rescue Committee said U.S. involvement in that conflict is doing a lot of harm. Let's listen."", ""The relationship that the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia needs to be put to good use. It's vital that the rightful call by the secretary of defense and the secretary of state to halt this war that is doing no good for American interests, never mind American values. It's vital that that call is followed through diplomatically at the highest levels."", 'Gayle, when you see the way that the Khashoggi killing consequences or lack thereof have played out, do you think the U.S. is giving up leverage it might have with the Saudis in Yemen?', ""No, certainly not. And we all need to know that Yemen is an amazing country with a beautiful culture, with incredible historical artifacts there that are really the patrimony of the entire human culture. So, certainly, when we're looking at this warfare going on in Yemen, it's a terrible, terrible thing, but Iran is an aggressor in this country, and Saudi Arabia is trying to make sure that the balance of power is not swayed towards Iran. So President Trump understands this very clearly, and he understands that given his campaign promises of putting America first that he has to take into account American interests in this area while also balancing the right of the Yemenis not to be in a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia."", 'Kimberly, the number of Yemeni lives lost, including children, seems a very high price to pay to keep Iran from having a center of power in the Middle East.', ""And it does, and the conflict there is also very complicated where the role that Saudi Arabia is playing in that. This is a prime opportunity for the United States to use that as leverage to say, look; we are to stand up against Saudi Arabia and the actions that they've taken that have claimed lives in this war. We have seen allies, including the U.K., pressing for a U.N. resolution to denounce Saudi Arabia and pressure them when it comes to the war in Yemen using this case, the awful murder of Jamal Khashoggi, as leverage. And it'll be interesting to see if the United States yields to that. They haven't come through so far. Certainly, the crown prince is unhappy at this effort. And so that will be a key thing moving forward."", ""Let's turn now to the Democratic Party and the growing evidence that the blue wave was bigger than people realized on election night. Kimberly, what do you think the lessons are for the two parties from the midterms?"", ""I mean, I think what we saw with the elections in both the Senate and the House, it really shows how divided the nation still is. But the Democrats did do very well. It didn't feel like a blue wave because it took a while. It was more like a blue flood that slowly rose and is reaching higher heights. But particularly in areas like suburbs where you have a lot of women voters, a lot of voters of color, there is a - there was a rebuke of the president. He put himself on the ballot before the election before he took himself back off after the election. But we also saw very strong places in - places in the Midwest and elsewhere where President Trump's support is still very strong. I think the country is dividing, and that's what we'll see play out through 2020."", ""Gayle, what's your takeaway?"", ""Well, Americans love divided government, so that is part of a grand history that we have. But I think you did see that this current administration has reached out to the cities to black populations. They had the young black conservative summit last month. And I think the Republican Party needs to continue to grow by addition and reach out to these communities that haven't traditionally been Republican and continue to make inroads promising them opportunity, economic opportunity, better education, and they shouldn't give up on those efforts."", ""I promised we'd get to Nancy Pelosi, but we're almost out of time, so I just have to ask each of you the yes-no question. Do you think she will be the next speaker of the House?"", 'Yes.', 'Yes.', '(Laughter) OK, simple as that. Columnist Gayle Trotter of the Right In DC blog and Kimberly Atkins of the Boston Herald, happy Friday. Hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving, and thanks for coming to the studio today.', 'Thank you.', 'Thanks for having me.']","['ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'GAYLE TROTTER', 'KIMBERLY ATKINS', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'KIMBERLY ATKINS', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'GAYLE TROTTER', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'GAYLE TROTTER', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'DAVID MILIBAND', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'GAYLE TROTTER', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'KIMBERLY ATKINS', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'KIMBERLY ATKINS', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'GAYLE TROTTER', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'GAYLE TROTTER', 'KIMBERLY ATKINS', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'GAYLE TROTTER', 'KIMBERLY ATKINS']"

Scott Walker Seeks Rare Third Term,"Gov. Scott Walker is currently trailing behind his Democratic opponent. He remains one of the only Republican Wisconsin lawmakers who hasn't joined the Trump administration, termed out or lost their seat to a Democrat.","[""Wisconsin is another one of those Midwest states that Democrats were banking on in 2016 but which ultimately went for President Trump. It's a purple state, meaning Democrats and Republicans are both competitive at times. But Republicans have controlled the state legislature for some time. Now, Republican Governor Scott Walker is seeking a rare third term in office there. And polling suggests it's his closest race yet. As Wisconsin Public Radio's Shawn Johnson reports, the circumstances couldn't be more different than when Walker was first elected eight years ago."", ""In 2010, Republicans captured 11 governors' offices previously held by Democrats.

Wisconsin is open for business."", ""But most of the class of 2010 has moved on. Some, like Brownback, took jobs in the Trump administration. Most, like Kasich, are term-limited. Walker, who has helped build a powerful Republican machine in Wisconsin, is now the only governor from that group who's running for a third term. And the latest poll from Marquette University showed his race is a tie. Marquette pollster Charles Franklin says it's a different landscape for Walker than in his previous runs because, for the first time, there's a Republican president in the White House."", ""Those are things that almost always work against the president's party, whether we're talking about congressional or gubernatorial elections. So Walker's facing headwinds on the national scene this year that he's not confronted in his previous elections."", ""Democratic ads in this race have hammered home Walker's tenure in office.

In Wisconsin, pre-existing conditions are covered, and as long as I'm governor, there always will be."", ""That caught President Obama's attention when he visited Milwaukee to campaign for Evers. He noted Walker was making the claim at the same time he was authorizing Wisconsin's participation in a lawsuit that seeks to overturn the ACA."", ""That is some kind of gall. That some kind of chutzpah. But let's also call what it is - it is a lie."", ""President Donald Trump has also gotten involved in Wisconsin's race.

Now, notice he's not going to places with the most vulnerable House seats because he might hurt them there more than he helps.

But it could happen. And you know what you do? My whole life, you know what I say? Don't worry about it. I'll just figure it out."", ""Trump likes to take credit for winning, and by campaigning in these Senate states, where he's still relatively popular - in some places, he won by upwards of 20 points in 2016 - he can still say on Tuesday, even if they lose the house, that, hey, look - I saved the Senate."", ""Let's talk about immigration for a minute. In recent days and recent weeks, the president's message has gotten really intense - harsh, even, I might say. Is that what his campaign is focusing on today?"", ""Republicans wish that he were focused a little bit more on the economy probably, especially after a really good jobs report on Friday. And he did talk about it at the top of his rally in Montana. But he still spent most of the time talking about immigration and this approaching caravan of migrant families from Central America seeking asylum. Now, of course, they're still far away from the border, and he said this week he'll send between 10,000 and 15,000 troops in a speech at the White House, which was really just a more official looking version of his stump speech sort of stoking these fears. And he even said that he would authorize them to fire on any migrants who were throwing rocks at the troops, and that he had to walk that back later on Friday."", ""You know, they're making a bet here that they can double down on this strategy of fear, really. And it's something that worked for Trump in 2016. That's the only campaign he's ever run. So he thinks that it worked then, but this is a much different election. When you're looking at the House especially, it's so different, and I'm not sure that you can win by running just a base election."", 'So what are Democrats saying in response to that?', ""They're really trying not to take the bait. Democrats are saying this is just the politics of fear and racism."", 'Well, then, do they have a message to counter that?', ""They've really been focused on health care - has been the issue that we have seen the most in ads by Democratic candidates and Democratic campaigns. The fact that the Republican health care plan that passed the House would have weakened protections on preexisting conditions - this is something that even Republicans are running ads now saying, hey, we would do this even when the bill they voted for would have weakened them."", ""You know, this is a winning issue for them, according to polls, and we will see if it bears that out on Tuesday. They lost the House in 2010 largely because of Obamacare's unpopularity. But, eight years later, this is the thing that could help them win it back. You know, and they're also stressing you have to go to the polls. If you didn't go out in 2016, look what happened.

How have U.S. presidents traditionally filled the role of consoler-in-chief after a national tragedy?,"['When President Trump and his family were in Pittsburgh yesterday, they placed stones at a memorial for the victims of the synagogue shooting. The president made no public remarks though he did later post a tweet.', 'He wrote that Pittsburgh had treated him warmly and showed the office of the president great respect on a sad and solemn day. He tweeted that he never saw protesters.', 'Just after the synagogue shooting on Saturday, Trump did speak publicly. First, he was off the cuff.', 'If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better.', 'Some people criticized him for that because it sounded like he was directing blame at the victims. Later he took a different tone in a scripted speech.', ""This evil anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us. It's an assault on humanity."", 'This is a role every president plays - the consoler in chief. And here to talk more with us on how presidents lead in times of tragedy is NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving. Hey, Ron.', 'Good to be with you, Ailsa.', 'So when did presidents start taking on this role? I mean, has it been a political tradition since the beginning of the presidency, or has it evolved over time?', ""It's been something presidents did for a long time but usually in a rather formal, written, usually distant fashion. And then comes the broadcast age. And after a natural disaster or after a national tragedy, the president is expected to speak. And a lot of Americans who remember that modern tradition of it - if they remember Ronald Reagan at all, he was so good at it. And really what people look back to is that moment when the Challenger spacecraft blew up in flight and killed seven astronauts in 1986."", 'We will never forget them nor the last time we saw them - this morning as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God.', 'It was chilling. It was warming. It was moving. And everyone who remembers the president saying it in real time - that is their Challenger moment.', 'Of course, not all presidents were known for being great orators the way Ronald Reagan was - for example, President George W. Bush. But he was known for spontaneous moments. Like, right after 9/11, there was this moment where he was standing on the rubble at Ground Zero - the Twin Towers were still smoldering in the background. And he grabs a bullhorn.', 'Well, the president was there to tour the ruins. And looking around with that sense that we all had of utter helplessness, someone shouts out...', ""We can't hear you."", ""...We can't hear you. And the president hadn't been trying to be heard. But he suddenly heard that voice."", 'I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.', ""So part of what made Bush's spontaneous remarks such a hit and so much a part history was because he addressed this issue of retribution, revenge. And revenge was what the country was thirsting for. But sometimes and more often, a president's address at a moment like this is also responsive to what people are feeling but is calling for forgiveness."", ""I'm thinking about President Obama. It was shortly after the shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston in 2015. He breaks into song during the eulogy of one of the victims."", '(Singing) Amazing grace, how sweet the sound...', 'He was so moved that he literally burst into song in that fashion - and, of course, counting on the congregation to join in with him as well.', '(Singing) ...That saved a wench like me.', 'I mean, these are moments that really draw out the distinct different kinds of leadership skills in each of these presidents.', 'At times of national tragedy, the nation is in the habit of looking for someone to play the role of a sympathetic parent if you will - someone to provide reassurance, empathy, uplift. We want someone to organize our grief for us, rally our spirits and begin the process of healing.', ""Let's talk now about how President Trump has tried to fill this role. After some of the hurricanes that we've had during his presidency, President Trump has gone to the site - in Texas, in Florida, Puerto Rico - and has tried to represent the country and the country's embrace of these victims. At times, it's worked. At other times, it's been quite awkward - particularly in Puerto Rico. And then there was the quickie news conference that he had after the Charlottesville disturbance in 2017 equating - or some people felt he was drawing up an equivalence between some of the people who came to rally as white supremacists, as white nationalists, as Nazis and the people who came to protest that rally."", ""I think there's blame on both sides. And I have no doubt about it. And you don't have any doubt about it either."", ""Do you think this way that Trump reacts in times of tragedy - do you think that that's a decision he is deliberately making about how to react? Or is he just someone who's uncomfortable playing the role of the empathetic consoler?"", ""In fairness, public shows of empathy are not President Trump's strong suit. He did not promise that sort of a presidency when he ran. Let's face it. He has a great talent for bonding with rally audiences. And it's just less comfortable for him to acknowledge the sorrowful details of a tragedy, such as Pittsburgh, and far less comfortable for him to yield to critics who urge him toward introspection."", ""But should presidents be judged if they're not good at consoling the country in times of tragedy?"", ""No president should be judged solely on that one particular part of his role that he has least control of. But there are going to be those people who are going to feel that a president should be able to provide something at a moment such as this that goes beyond a political observation and address the nation's needs and hunger at the level of the soul."", ""That's NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving.

Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times about confirmation hearings, an anonymous op-ed from inside the White House and former President Obama on the campaign trail.","[""So that's how the week played out for President Trump. We're going to begin our week in politics with E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution. Hey there, E.J."", 'Great to be with you.', 'And David Brooks of The New York Times, welcome back.', 'Thank you.', 'OK, so I want to jump into that growing bookshelf. Obviously as Scott mentioned - mentions, Bob Woodward\'s new book, ""Fear,"" and this anonymous op-ed published by The New York Times that made headlines this week - they allege all the same thing - right? - that members of the Trump administration are trying to moderate in some ways what they consider his worst impulses by ignoring him or acting in ways that are against his wishes. David Brooks, I\'m going to start with you because this - you share space on the op-ed page (laughter) with this...', 'With anonymous.', '...With anonymous. Was this a heroic act or a cowardly one?', ""I wish some of my columns were anonymous. It would be good. It was a stupid act (laughter). You know, if you're going to be protecting the president from himself, don't tell him. And so, you know, it's going to make him be much more erratic and much more willful in the face of White House aides."", ""The larger issue is we have basically a running crisis in the White House, just a chaotic situation with the seat of power of the world's greatest superpower. And the question is, does it ever really spill out of control into something truly and immediately dangerous? Norms are being eroded. Alliances are being weakened. But so far we haven't had a complete crackup on the rocks where the whole nation is suddenly in danger."", ""Although according to this person, they believe it's due to their fine work in the White House anonymously."", '(Laughter).', ""E.J. Dionne, what do you make of Trump's response - because he's calling for the Justice Department to investigate."", ""Well, you know, if it's illegal for a presidential aide to criticize their president off the record or without naming themselves, then hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of news stories over the last decades have been illegal acts because of course news stories are full of people who work for the White House who take issue with the president to reporters in order to send a signal perhaps to the president and sometimes to the outside."", ""So the notion that he's calling in the Justice Department to investigate something that is clearly not a crime is yet another crime on the part of the president. I'm not somebody who believes in hastening impeachment. I want to wait for Mueller, and I want more of a consensus. But this is going to be on that list. I think that this warning is useful that this aide put out there. I think this person should come out and put their name on it."", ""President Obama had something to say about this. In a speech today before - a speech in Illinois, he was calling out President Trump by name. President Obama said, look; this idea that everything will turn out OK because there are people inside the White House who secretly aren't following the president's orders - it's not how democracy is supposed to work. He also accused President Trump of capitalizing on resentment that politicians have been fanning for years."", 'It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause.', ""David, this is a speech that a lot of people were saying kind of kicks off midterms or kicks off President Obama's return to politics. What did you read of it?"", ""Well, I - wouldn't be the line of attack I'd use I think. Saying he kicks off resentment, saying he's radical, saying this is not conservative - these are the same arguments that Democrats tried to use against Donald Trump in 2016. It seems to me the weakness is in corruption. That is something that I think swing voters do actually move and get votes on. And the second is what he's doing to the world our children inherit. Those are the two things that I think actually could swing voters a little more effectively than the line that Donald Trump - that Barack Obama gave, which is pretty much the conventional line we've been hearing from Democrats for two years."", ""E.J., was this necessary? There are a lot of Democratic voices out there, a lot of people who are kind of vying to be the leading voice of the party. What do you make of Barack Obama's return, so to speak?"", 'Oh, I think it is necessary. And I just note that his speech had a lot of elements, including, by the way, the corruption issue. He specifically went at the Republicans and implicitly the Trump administration. And he had a whole list of issues that he threw at the Republicans - killing campaign finance laws, making it harder to vote, handing out tax cuts without regard for deficits and the like.', ""Barack Obama is still the spokesman for the Democratic Party because no obvious other spokesperson has emerged yet. You saw in the Kavanaugh hearings, which we're going to hear about, some new voices. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris were very prominent. But no one dominates the scene like Barack Obama. No one can turn out Democratic voters like Barack Obama. So he's going to be very important. And I think this is the first draft of a pretty good argument that he's going to make. I did like the line, we're supposed to stand up to bullies, not follow them."", ""I want to talk about that hearing. It's Day 4 of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings. There have been many pointed questions from Democrats."", 'Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?', 'Is it still true that you can give no assurance that you would uphold a statute requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing medical conditions?', 'Why do you think the NRA is spending so much money to ensure that you get confirmed as a Supreme Court justice?', 'So, E.J., did you learn anything new about this nominee?', ""He was so cautious. There were times when he was even almost squirrelly in his answers. He wouldn't go out there even and criticize some of the things that Trump said about judges which a lot of other conservative judges have. What we saw is how furious progressives are over what's happening on the court - first the blocking of Merrick Garland, which no one has forgotten, and now this effort to push through Kavanaugh before the elections, holding back tens of thousands of documents. And there was an explosion of frustration."", ""I don't think this will move Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who are the two votes the Democrats need to block Kavanaugh. But I think that it will increase pressure on them. I just don't think they're willing to buck their party. Although I believe they should be."", 'And, David, what do you think was the most important or significant moment to come out of the hearings this week?', ""Well, the Democrats have had several months to find something to make - to embarrass Kavanaugh, and they've basically come up with nothing. The guy's life seems to have been amazingly squeaky clean. Most of us would have some embarrassing thing, but they've found nothing."", ""The only potential landmine for him is these Miranda memos, these memos early 2000s. The Republican - a Republican staffer stole some Democratic memos, and the question is, did Kavanaugh ever see them? He's claimed he didn't. Some emails suggest maybe he didn't. That's the only landmine. Other than that, he's - he evaded the way all justices do now, so we learned nothing about him. And there seems to be nothing in his past except for an extensive and highly respected legal career."", ""That's David Brooks of The New York Times and E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution. Thank you both."", 'Good to be with you.', 'Thank you.']","['AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'E J DIONNE, BYLINE', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE', 'DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'E J DIONNE, BYLINE', 'E J DIONNE, BYLINE', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'E J DIONNE, BYLINE', 'E J DIONNE, BYLINE', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'KAMALA HARRIS', 'SHELDON WHITEHOUSE', 'MAZIE HIRONO', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'E J DIONNE, BYLINE', 'E J DIONNE, BYLINE', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE', 'DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE', 'AUDIE CORNISH, HOST', 'E J DIONNE, BYLINE', 'DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE']"

It was a politically risky speech, coming in the immediate aftermath of the Reverend Jeremiah Wright controversy.', 'But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now. We would be making the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons about America, to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality.', ""The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through, a part of our union that we have not yet to perfect."", 'And if we walk away now, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for every American.', 'And yet more than 18 months into his presidency, issues involving race persist, raising the question of whether we are moving forward or backward, or perhaps both.', ""one black, one white, one Latino.

Welcome to all three of you."", 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', '(Host, ""Latino USA"") Good to be here.', 'Let me say this to our listeners first, because we want to hear from you as well.

We will be here for the next hour.', 'Let me begin by putting this question out, and I will ask the same one to the three of you, and I will begin with you, Maria. Why is race uncomfortable in 2010?', 'Why is race uncovered?', 'Uncomfortable.', ""Uncomfortable. Hmm, because I think actually what the president said is right. We don't like to talk about it. For a lot of people, it's something uncomfortable, and I think about, for example, what happened in my own life once, when I was - my kids were in private school in New York City, and an issue came up with one of the other parents."", ""She's African-American. She was actually a corrections officer on Riker's Island. But she had her daughter in this private school, and the conversation came up around kids playing, like, make-believe with guns during recess. And some of the kids were playing like this."", ""Well, it turns out that her husband was a livery driver in New York City, a cab driver, and he was shot and killed by a gun. And so there was kind of this uncomfortableness. And what I did was, I was like, you know what? We just need to talk about this because we're dropping off our kids at school together, and we're assuming that they're going to figure it out. We need to talk about this."", 'Everybody was so taken by the fact that we just put it out there. And we went there, and we talked about - about race in a way that was very kind of personal, very kind of to our families. And it was like it was a safe space.', ""But I'll never forget the fact that people just thought that that moment was something extraordinary in their lives because we talked about it. And I think that we, we don't really have the tools do that because we don't really see it happening a lot, a lot of jokes, but we don't really see smart people sitting around talking a lot and often about this issue."", ""In an honest way. David Gergen, what do you say? I'm assuming that you agree with me that race is an uncomfortable topic in 2010. Do you?"", ""Yes, I certainly do. And I think it's perhaps more uncomfortable now than it was only a couple of years ago when Barack Obama was running for president."", 'I think most Americans understand in terms of black-white relations we made enormous progress from the days that Martin Luther King was protesting on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to the days that Barack Obama was inaugurated as president on the other end of the Washington Mall. And there have been significant gains.', ""But Tony, the gaps that remain are so vast - in achievement, in schools, income levels, in obesity rates that we've been reading about recently, and so many other different ways. And the conversation has now expanded about race."", ""I think now we also, when we talk about race, we talk about minorities. Hispanics have come into this conversation because they're such a force and such a large, growing force in the American population. And it's made the conversation even perhaps more complex."", ""And there - even as we're in a time of great promise, I think there's a growing recognition in the country that we have so many of these gaps to overcome, that unless we do that, the country could be imperiled."", 'Do you think for you, Leonard Pitts, that race is an uncomfortable topic?', ""It is not uncomfortable for me, but it seems to be uncomfortable for a lot of people who read me. And I think that a good part of the reason for that is that there is no - we have not evolved safe spaces, where people can have these discussions, where if you are white and of good will you can have an honest discussion about the things you understand, the things you don't understand, without the fear that someone is either going to reflexively call you a racist or try to impose some guilt on you or that you're going to feel some guilt, you know, conversely that you don't necessarily want to feel."", ""It's really difficult for people to let down the barriers and let down the guard enough to really have these discussions, and that's the - you know, that's what I think I'm hearing said in different ways, you know, my comments and the other two comments that preceded mine, and yet at the same time there is no discussion that is more important for us to have."", 'If you look at pretty much all the major domestic issues that we are concerned about, if you look at the environment, if you look at education, if you look at crime, all of these things, there is a strong racial component. There is a racial component that underlies all of these things. And yet we have this sort of see-no-evil attitude.', ""A lady told me once, in chiding me about talking about race, that it wasn't polite. And that struck me as such an odd choice of words. It's as if I had done something, you know, ill-mannered at the dinner party. Race is one of those things that you just don't discuss."", 'The elephant in the room.', 'It is the elephant in the elevator.', 'This is TALK...', 'But if you have...', 'Go ahead, go ahead, Maria.', ""But if you have - see, I think that that's - and I agree with you, Leonard, and I think that the thing is that as a journalist, you know, I talk about anything to anyone at any time. That's kind of my modus operandi."", 'politics, you know, whatever.', ""Or they see when I'm - they see what's happening when - on Broadway, they'll see the interaction between an undocumented Mexican immigrant and how he's treated by a particular person, and we talk about that. Or I'll engage with that person."", ""Am I exposing them too much? But then it's like you know what? It's not like - it's not like overwhelming. It's not like a lesson. It's how I live. I live a kind of organic diversity in my experience, and I want my children to understand that they do, and that part of that means you can, in fact, talk about who you are, talk about, you know, the fact that your godmother is African-American, but, you know, your (unintelligible) is Mexican. No problem."", ""We talk about it. But I agree with Leonard, where it's that we don't really have, like, we don't have a model for how to do that. All we know is that it's something hard, difficult, taboo. So we don't go there. We don't even try."", ""Although I want to say that, you know, having been now to 49 of the 50 states, you know, we have to give props to a lot of people who are actually out there doing it and living it and talking about it. So, you know, when we talk about race, it's always from this place of, like, how bad it is."", ""There's also a lot of places that are doing things right and a lot of people who are doing things right as well."", ""Hopefully we can get to some of that. What I'd like to do, let me say to the three of you, because we haven't had a chance to talk together before we got on the air - I'm going to be asking you some question that are a little personal, and I don't want you to be put off by them. But I'm hoping that we can have as honest a conversation as we can, and that includes me, in terms of sharing things."", ""This is TALK OF THE NATION, by the way. If you'd like to join this conversation about race, you can reach us, 800-989-8255. The email address is talk@npr.org."", 'Are whites, in your opinion, who are non-racists, are they afraid to say the way that they really feel about race and being white?', ""Huh. I think there is a sense among whites that there are politically incorrect things that should not be said that worry them, and they don't know quite how to deal with it. And I think we have seen this - two national incidents over the last, you know, 12, 14 months, with the Skip Gates here in Cambridge, with the white cop, and then the incident most recently with Shirley Sherrod."", 'In both cases I think that there was a tendency to be afraid to talk, and some people said too much. You know, they were too - in the Shirley Sherrod case they were too quick to condemn. But in both cases I think we saw the difficulty we have of being sort of honest with each other about some of these issues.', 'And I must say to Maria, I think the country is having a hard time having a conversation about the Hispanic population. We see the Arizona immigration law that, you know, that many on one side have condemned as being unfair and singling out Hispanics in totally inappropriate ways.', ""And yet we see, and you look at national polls, and there's a lot of support for it. We haven't had an honest discussion, it seems to me, about the fears that some whites have about where the country is going and the sense that Hispanics have."", ""In Arizona itself I think there's a poll out there that showed about 70 percent of Hispanics oppose that new Arizona immigration law, whereas among whites the support was about 67 percent, so..."", '(Unintelligible)', ""David, let me - let me stop you both there, only because, only because we have to take this quick short break, and we'll come back, and we'll pick up on that very point that you are making."", ""We are having an honest, open conversation about race, and we'll get to more of your calls in just a moment.

It comes from Valia(ph)."", ""I believe it is uncomfortable for older people. I'm 28, Hispanic and have black, white, Asian friends. We do not see our color. If anything, our parents put colors into our heads and race in our heads as well. What do you think of that, the two of you, Maria and David, and also you, Leonard?"", ""Well, what I was going to say is that the conversation around Arizona is - just to finish that, button that up, David, and you're right, there's - there is, for the Latino population, a sentiment, if you just turn on the Spanish language media, you see it and you hear it, you feel it in all - there's a sentiment that right now this is a population that is under attack."", ""Now, what happens to me is that that breaks my heart. Not as a Latina. It breaks my heart as an American, and that's what I think is so hard about this. And, you know, again, I think what we need to understand is that when you talk about race, and that's why I appreciate what the email was just about, I think so often times, as I said with the kids in my kids' school, you know, the parents were like, oh, let the kids figure out how to deal with diversity. We don't have to talk about that."", ""It's like, no, actually we do. We do have to talk about it. But you have to be prepared to open up the conversation. And you keep saying, Tony, if you have an idea of something that works, you know what? Again, as a journalist, what I do is I talk to people."", ""It's so basic, and we can talk structurally about what needs to happen. We can talk about, you know, class division, and we can talk about many different aspects of how race expresses itself in our country. But you have to talk, and you have to, I think, allow yourself to be put into an uncomfortable situation, and that's it."", ""But it raises the question, and David, I'd like to get your answer to the one about whether or not this is something that old people have a problem with, and the younger people don't, and then I want to get to the calls because we have a lot of them that are lined up. What's your thought on that?"", ""Tony, I believe very strongly that we have too much people in this country thinking us versus them, and we've all got to see we're all in this together, because the future of the country is tied up."", 'I think this question the email raises is fundamental, about the old versus the young. There\'s an excellent new article by Ron Brownstein in the cover piece in the National Journal this week on the generational mismatch, and it\'s called ""The Gray and the Brown.""', ""And what Brownstein points out is that if you look at the younger population, below the age of 18, 44 percent of that population in the country today is minority. And it's growing. It's going to be over 50 percent by 2023."", 'Whereas if you look at the older population, over 65, 80 percent of it is white, and there is a mismatch and a gulf here about how to see, how to even think about the role of government, diversity, all these issues.', 'The younger generation is very different and extremely important for all of us that this younger generation - we close these achievement gaps, we work very hard on the education of minorities.', ""It's extraordinarily important for the future of the country we close those achievement gaps. I'd like to come back to that at some point. But I do think there's a generational gulf here that we not only need to talk, as Maria has said, as Leonard has said, we also need to act. We need to close achievement gaps."", ""I'm going to come to you in a minute, Leonard, because I want to get one of these calls. I know you're over there, and you have some things to say. Trust me, you will get the opportunity to do it. But let's go and take a call from Cincinnati. Is it Cello(ph)?"", 'Yes, sir. Hi, Tony.', 'How are you?', 'Excuse me?', 'I said, how are you?', ""Oh, I'm great. How are you doing?"", ""I'm doing great. We'd like to hear you comment."", ""I'd like to compliment Leonard Pitts for a moment, if I can. I appreciate his articles. He's one of my most favorite journalists."", 'Thank you.', ""I'd like to go into how some of the issues of viewpoints kind of aren't really addressed for each ethnic group."", 'Well, can you give us sort of a brief one? Pick the main one.', ""An example is the Arizona bill. I've been hearing recently about most Arizonans like the bill. I hear it on the news almost nightly. And I don't know who they're talking about, as I was telling your screener. Who exactly are the people who support the bill? I'm sure it's not the Hispanics that support the bill."", ""Well, it would be - thank you for that call very much - certainly some of the people who are residents of the state of Arizona have made it clear that they are the ones who are in support of it. Who are they? The presumption is that it's primary white people that we are talking about in the state of Arizona. If you've ever gone there, that would be a reasonable assumption to draw."", ""Here's another call. This one is Jason in Maryville, I think it's Maryville, Tennessee. Jason, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION."", ""Yeah, I'm here. Good to be on the air. You know, I think one of the biggest problems that we have is the respect of our own race, to start with. You know, you have, for instance, white people, and I'm a white person - you know, we go to our friends, and we're out together, and you know, you hear people say, you know, how you doing, my white honky and stuff like that."", ""And then you've got black people, which I have as friends as well. They use the N-word amongst themselves, you know, what's going on, my N - you know. And I think the other races see that, and they, you know, figure why should we respect their race when they don't respect it theirselves to start with. And..."", 'Well, Jason - you have one other quick point you want to make, because I want to get to another call as well.', ""Yeah, yeah, real quick. With Latino, you know, I - there is nothing at all wrong with them being here and working and doing stuff. I think one of the biggest problems is, is that it would definitely help if we had documentation and was able to make sure everybody was citizens, you know (unintelligible) but there's nothing wrong with them being here at all working and providing for their family."", ""Thank you for that call, for both those comments. Leonard, you've been very patient. Here's a question for you. Just try to move the conversation along a little bit, and then we will go and take some more calls and talk again with David Gergen and with Maria Hinojosa."", 'Do you think that private conversations about race are different between blacks than they are between whites and that they are between Latinos?', 'You mean blacks talking to blacks about race and whites...', 'Yeah.', 'Oh, of course they are. Of course they are.', 'How would you know?', ""I think there is less - I would know what they are - well, I would know from personal experience, because I'm been among African- Americans, hearing African-Americans talk about race in ways that they never would among whites. I've had many whites confide to me via email and the Internet on the column the way that they talk about race with one another versus the way that they talk about it in public."", ""I get told things that I know would never be said in public by people, which tells me that we're talking about basically two sets of discussions going on. But I wanted to go back to the - I believe it was the email person who said - or the person who sent the email, that said that essentially this is a problem of the old, and the young people sort of have it all figured out."", 'And that amused me greatly because I remember thinking the same thing when I was a young person.', 'When I was in college, and I, you know, for the first - I grew up in segregated Los Angeles, and I went to college, and I suddenly had all these white friends. You know, I think of them as sort of these good-natured, shaggy-haired white guys, and we were all beyond all of that.', ""Race was something that our parents were hung up on, but we were concerned about things that were - and here's a '70s word for you - relevant - okay, and race wasn't one of those things. We were so far beyond it."", 'And frankly, I look back on that from the vantage point of 20, 30 years later and think, one, how naÃ¯ve I was, and two, how, you know, we have really not moved the goalpost.', ""We've moved, we've made changes, but we really haven't moved it as far as we would like to think we have. And I think that it's sort of dangerous to sort of leave this or to embrace this idea that the kids will work it out because what happens is that the kids invariably grow up to be us."", ""Well, that's true, and let me come back, let me circle back around to you, David Gergen, on this question, because Leonard says that he has ins in white people's conversations, and so he can, he can - he's told things. I'm teasing him a little bit, but I know that he means what he says, and it's true."", ""But what's your perspective on how whites talk about race when they are with one another? And I will say before you answer that, there is a, oh, a stereotypical perception that I think black people have that white people, when they are talking amongst each other, that they're talking about us."", ""I don't think, I don't think that - white conversations among whites-only kind of thing, I don't that it turns to the question of blacks or Hispanics as much as people may think."", 'But when it does, I think the conversation as a general proposition, as a general rule, is far better today, far more respectful today than it was 30 or 40 years ago.', ""I grew up in - I'm white and I grew up in a segregated South. And I remember the conversations back in the '50s and '60s and that they are very, very different today. And it's regarded as really poor taste in almost all white groups that I know to make racial slurs a one way or another, just as in poor taste to make gender slurs. Does it happen? Yes, it does happen. Do people harbor these sort of deeper feelings and questions in their mind? They do harbor them. I think they are more careful about how they express them and you don't - and people are - it's really - you know, when get down with your closest friend, you may say something that you don't say something over dinner with a group of eight or 10 people."", ""Let me read a couple of emails that we got. And then, Maria, I'm going to come to you and ask you a different question. We hear a lot - this comes from David. We hear a lot of talk about where the country is headed. Please encourage your guests to discuss exactly what this means. What are white people afraid of and why? And number two, please have your guests discuss the role of the Internet in allowing people to vent their feelings about race."", ""Here's another one. This is from Parker(ph) in Madison, Wisconsin. My question is addressed to those of you who have commented on the lack of safe spaces in our society for discussion about race. What do you mean by safe space and who should be creating them and how do you create one?"", ""And here's another one. This is from Drew(ph) in Columbus, Ohio. Oftentimes I find that it is difficult to distinguish between issues of race and issues of class. How much of this is simply the haves versus the have-nots?"", ""And the very last one, and then to Maria, to you. This isn't to you. I'm coming to you right after I read this. This is from Twitter. Do you invite conversations about race? Why or why not? I used to, but I don't anymore. I'm Caucasian, which seems to inherently imply that I am a racist."", ""Maria, you're Latina. Do you feel left out of the race conversation at any time in this country when the focus is on black and white?"", ""Well, you know, it was weird because when you said that, Tony, you're a Latina, do you feel left out? And I was like, heck no, I don't feel left out."", ""You know, I don't feel left out. But at the same time, yes, I think that too often we - when we talk about race, it becomes this black-white scenario. And the fact is, is it's much more complicated. I mean, I think even ourselves, even the terminology that we use, that has been used just in the past few minutes, it's terminology that we need to question again. It's, you know, for example, the term minority. I've never used that term in my family. I've never - I try not to use it on the air, on my show. I try not to use it when I'm doing television scripts, because that word doesn't say anything to me anymore. And I certainly don't want my kids growing up thinking that they're a member of a minority group. And certainly now, it's like, what are you talking about minorities? It's like we're all just one huge minority - or it's different. Those terms don't apply anymore."", ""And about the issue of youth - just coming back. I mean, again, I think that that - and that's why I'm talking about this, because of course, even as I'm talking about this, I'm like, well, you know, I see this issue from so many different perspectives, but I really want to be sure to bring in the Latino issue. But I see it from so many different perspectives. But to bring in the issue of youth and, you know, this assumption that it's working out. Right now in Staten Island, okay, in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty..."", ""Let me stop you only because - and since you're already a host, you know all about what I'm about to do."", ""You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."", ""Okay, Maria. So finish your point, and then we'll go - and then we'll move on."", ""Okay. So in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, Staten Island, over the past several months there has been a rash of hate-crime assaults against Mexican workers. This is not Texas. It's not Arizona. It's not Alabama. It's New York City. And until this story - and we're doing an investigation of it ourselves on LATINO USA, but until this story broke on an English language newspaper, no one knew. We knew. People who understand that community knows. So - and who is doing the assaulting? And this is what - it's so hard for us to talk about. You know, I'll take off my American, my - how much this hurts me as an American. I'll put on my journalist hat."", ""And don't forget now, we've got to get to some calls as well, so..."", ""Okay. Who's doing this? Young African Americans. So talk about what we need to talk about and what I believe is the front burner issue that we're not talking about, is African American and Latinos. It's hugely important."", ""All right. We will try to explore that some more. Let's get to some calls and then we'll circle back to hear more from David Gergen and Leonard Pitts as well. The first one, this is James calling from Indianapolis, Indiana. Welcome, James."", ""Hi. I think, you know, just looking at race with a little bit more complexity, a lot of it has to deal with the business of otherness and this country's roots, starting with a Puritanical kind of base. The others came, they were judged in a negative light. And the complexity of race could be opened up more with the president acknowledging that he's bi-racial, and there's nothing wrong with that. And acknowledging his mother would be acknowledging more of himself as a whole."", 'Blacks were originally defined by 1/32nd or one drop. The definition of tainted blood is a negative way of defining oneself, and this continues to play out not only as - just look at blacks that have continued to define themselves to this negative definition.', ""James, thank you very much for the call. Let's take another one. This is Nick in Grass Lake, I believe that is Michigan. Oop, wrong one. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, Nick. I'm coming right to you. Just got to find the right button. There you are. Are you there?"", 'Hi. Am I there?', 'Yes, you are, Nick. Welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.', ""Thanks for taking my call. I guess this, in a way, it's related to what your last caller just said. I'm an anthropology graduate student. One of the most important things we're taught is that the notion of biological race is something that we've sort of constructed to support this idea of otherness, that there isn't any clear line between, you know, a white person and a black person. The race essentially doesn't exist. And it's something that seems very hard for people to swallow because it's so engrained in how we talk about things. They think it's something that might be important to talk about and insert into sort of the discourse surrounding all of it."", 'And one of the things made me think of this is because I have a - for lack of better word - a mixed race nephew. And his family, when he talked about things, it\'s very much with this sort of a dichotomy in mind. And they - his mother had expressed to me her gratitude for Disney making a movie - I think their most recent, ""Princess and the Frog"" or something...', ""Nick, I've got to stop you only because time - the clock is running out on me. I appreciate your call. And we're going to try to get to all the others. We are going to continue this conversation in just a moment. We are talking about race, what has changed, what hasn't since the election of President Barack Obama, and how does race play out in your lives and what are your experiences. Our phone number is 800-989-8255. The email address, talk@npr.org. Stay with us. I'm Tony Cox. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR news."", ""Right now we're talking about race, specifically how we talk about race in America and how that has or has not changed in the last 18 months since the election of President Obama. How does the question of race play out in your daily lives? What are your experiences? If you have ideas that will help shed light on how we view and interact with each other, we want to hear your story. Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr.org. And you can join the conversation at our website. Just go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION."", ""Leonard Pitts, we started this conversation actually with a clip from President Obama's speech in 2008 during the Jeremiah Wright controversy. And I think a lot of people thought that this may be - some people did, I know - the beginning of a changing paradigm with regard to race in this country. Here is another clip from the president in that same speech. And in this one, this is what the president said about what he saw in the white community."", ""Most working and middle-class white Americans don't feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience. As far as they're concerned, no one handed them anything, they've built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pensions dumped after a lifetime of labor."", ""They are anxious about their futures, and they feel their dreams slipping away, and in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town, when they hear an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed, when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudice, resentment builds over time."", ""Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation."", ""So here's a caller, Leonard. We'll listen to what she has to say and then we'll talk about it. David, I want to bring you into this as well. This is Emily from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Emily, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION."", 'Hi.', ""Your - what's your comment?"", ""Well, I'm a pizza delivery driver and I'm white. And I'm in my early 20s. And I've been doing this for about a year now. And I've delivered to people of all these kind of races. And I've had, you know, I've had some Hispanics scrape together quarters and dimes to give me a good tip. But maybe one of it every 15 deliveries to an African American will actually give me a tip."", 'And I have friends, African American friends, who say that their parents will actually put away the tip money if they see a white driver coming up.', ""All right, thank you for that call. So she's got this sort of reverse racism thing that's bothering her. As an African American man, how do you feel and how do you respond and what do you say to white people who feel like black folks are racist toward them?"", ""I would say that some of them certainly are. I mean, here's the thing that we seem to forget. Racism or bigotry or whatever you want to call it is not the unique property of any one species of God's children. You know, we all have this lizard-like capacity to dislike people based on the fact that they look differently than us, than they love differently than us, that they live some place that we don't live, that they are - speak differently than us, whatever, whatever."", ""The only difference and the thing that people fail to understand is when - when my white readers talk to me about how - black racism against them, one of the questions that I always want to ask them is, and can you tell me how that has impacted upon your quality of life in the large scale? Nine times out of 10, they cannot. If you ask a black person how white racism has impacted upon their life, they're going to talk about the police that pulled over for no reason. They're going to talk about the loan they didn't get. They're going to talk about being racially profiled in the store, et cetera, et cetera. And this is - this doesn't mean that, you know, that one group is better than the other. What it means is that one group is larger than the other and has access to the levers of power, so that when there is racism they can encode that racism in the structure of the society. That's all that it means."", 'David Gergen, do whites think that the idea of white privilege is a myth?', ""I think they, probably, largely do. But, you know, there's been so much increase in income among elites recently that it's really hard to, you know, to live with that."", ""But I want to go back to something, if I could, Tony, something very fundamental you started with a few minutes ago. And that - about - you raised a question about what is this - what's all this mean for the future of the country. I want to go to something very fundamental. Barack Obama captured, in that speech, I think, the resentments and fears and prejudices of a lot of whites, very well. He had a real ear for it, and, you know, understanding of it. And one of those fears is all about urban crime and urban dropout rates and what does this mean. And there's a sense among some whites in the country at large that, you know, that poor kids who are black or Hispanic can't learn. They're going to have current lives that are broken in one way or another and wind up in prison. And the truth of the matter is that's a myth. It's just not true."", ""If you go into Harlem today, you'll see what Geoff Canada is doing. You go to the Harlem Village Academies, you go to the KIPP schools, you see these kids can learn, and they can do very, very well. And it - they - if we have better schools, these kids are going to make it, and they'll be fine. But right now - you had Cornel West on your program here, recently."", 'Yes.', ""And he talked about the prison-industrial complex. That is a very real fact that we have to deal with. What we have now is, if you're a - Marian Wright Edelman makes this point. If you're a black male, today, growing up, you've got a one in three chance going to prison. If you're a Hispanic male growing up today, in America, you've got a one in six chance of going to prison. If you're a white male growing up in this country today, you have a one in 17 chance of going to prison. Those are disparities we can't live with as a country, and they're just reversed on education with whites having, you know, having far more - far better rates of finishing college."", 'But David, let me ask you...', ""We have to overcome these things. It's vital for the country."", ""Let me ask you this before we take a caller. Black people think that is because of race, all right, those disparities - that it's racism and it's race - it's the racist's white power structure that is causing that imbalance that you have just described. Do white people think it's because of race - as well?"", ""Yes, they do think it's partly because of race. But one of the great things that's going on in the younger generation today, is there are a lot of kids - I happen to be on the board for Teach for America national board. And we have tons and tons of young people of all backgrounds who now want to go out and teach in these urban schools, and they're making great progress. But you know who's opposing a lot of these changes and trying to block some of these changes in charter school? It's the teacher's unions. You know, it's not just the right that's been a problem here. Some of the teacher's unions come from the left. And we've got to deal with that question if we're going to overcome these disparities."", ""If we have a country, as we do today, with 44 percent of the people under 18 who are black or Hispanic - and that number soon is going to grow to 50 percent and higher - it's vital for the country that we end these injustices and end these disparities and bring people up. We've got to have educated African-Americans and Hispanics at the same rates as whites. It's hugely important for our future."", ""Let's take a call, and then, Leonard, I'll let you respond. And then, Maria, I know you're still there. You're still there, right, Maria?"", ""I'm waiting patiently. I'm waiting patiently."", ""I appreciate your patience, because you know this is a very important topic and everyone wants to get an opportunity to contribute. So Tiffany(ph), you're up next, from Owensboro, Kentucky. Welcome. Tiffany?"", 'Hi. Yes.', 'Hi.', 'Hi. Thank you for taking my call. First, I want to start by saying, Mr. Pitts, I enjoy reading your articles in the Messenger- Inquirer.', 'Thank you.', 'What I do want to say is, I believe that because Barack Obama is president, I feel like the floodgates of racism discussions is more open. Every one is speaking about it more. More issues are arising. My main thing is, is this really healthy for his presidency, as he is calling on a national discussion for racism himself, is it healthy for his presidency or will this be kind of like a dark cloud over him?', ""Well, that'd be interesting to find. Leonard, do you want to comment on that?"", 'I actually want to go back to something that Mr. Gergen said because I think he touched on something very important. He was talking about the fact that so many people take it for granted that African- American and Latino kids are ineducable, and that this feeling persists, even in the light of empirical proof that this is wrong. I think when he says that, what he does is he hits on sort of a very fundamental truth about why we still have trouble with race in this country. We tend to make our decisions and tend to base our perceptions on caricature, which is impervious to fact.', 'I\'ve been writing in my column recently, about the drug war and about the fact that the overwhelming majority of drug users and drug dealers in this country, statistically, are white. And it is so difficult to get that past people\'s filters, because in our minds and the popular imagination the, quote, unquote, ""drug user and drug dealer"" are some black kids on a corner in Baltimore.', ""That's not the common - or the most common picture. But we have these caricatures, these, sort of, narratives in our head that we are absolutely stuck on and invested in. And we got to get beyond those before we're going to make any kind of progress."", 'I would think, Maria, that that also applies to the Latino community as well.', ""Yeah, absolutely, because what you - what's happened now, is there's kind of a talk, a tone of the talk, a tone of the conversation that - you know, I want people to be honest, right? We want people to be honest. But when somehow it's acceptable to kind of make certain racial statements about certain groups, even in the media, when people hear that kind of talk on certain networks, you know, it doesn't fall on deaf ears. Sometimes, this is what - and especially when you're talking about young people, which is what worries me."", ""When they kind of see, like, oh, check it out, these adults are talking this way, and they're doing this stuff, and they're throwing around these words, and a lot of these, you know, they're seen in popular culture; and they kind of think like, hmm, okay, well, we can talk this way too. And that's the other side of, you know, the openness of race, the new generation, the new demographic. The other side is almost that certain things, certain perspectives, certain ways of seeing other people, because of, in part, what's happened with the media, it's become even more a part of who these young people are - who we are as a country - and that is incredibly worrisome to me."", ""Absolutely. Let's take another call. Let's go Antonio(ph) in Berkeley, California. Antonio, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION."", 'Hi. Am I on?', 'Yes, you are. How are you?', ""Thank you. I'd just like to address - being a mixed-race individual, I'd like - if you guys could talk about mixed-race experiences, because you guys are really strictly along the lines of race and about how maybe this, like, racial group, does this. And I feel like people in the borderlines, really are kind of marginalized within each individual community and in the entire talk of race as a whole."", 'May I ask you a question as a mixed-race person?', 'Yes.', 'The question I have for you, is whether or not you feel a tug or a push or a pull to move towards one half of your racial identity versus the other half.', ""Actually, I'm tri-racial."", 'Okay, well, then...', 'Do you feel pulled in three...', 'God bless America.', '...directions, in terms of identifying with one group over the other?', ""I think it really depends on the individual I'm talking to at the time. As a whole, I don't feel a tug or a push by my family. But certain people want me to be, like, identify more with a specific race at any given time, depending on the context - especially if I'm with them in kind of a minority setting. As if, if it's a predominantly white setting and if someone else is Latino, sometimes they'd want you - me to identify more as being a Latino rather than not."", ""And what do you do when in you're that circumstance?"", ""It really depends on the context. If it's going to cause a lot of trouble and ruckus, I generally don't do too much. But I don't know. I try to explain it, like, you know, I identify with all of my identities..."", 'As much as you can.', '...(unintelligible).', 'Antonio, thank...', 'Thank you.', ""...you for that call. Let me ask you, David Gergen, then swing around to Maria, and then come back to you, Leonard, about that. Because when we talk about, you know, we're talking today, black, white, Latino, we don't have any Asians on our group today, not - it wasn't done maliciously. It was just - there's only so many people you can talk with at one time. We don't talk much about mixed race, even though we have a mixed race president in the White House, David Gergen."", ""Absolutely. Let me say, first of all, I really appreciate what Leonard Pitts just said a few moments ago. I've got to - Leonard, I've got to go read some of your columns. But I think you're absolutely right..."", 'Thank you.', ""...about the narrative, that we have narratives stuck in our heads, and sometimes we're impervious to facts. But I do think it's imperative, and I think here's where the president - the president has been reticent, I think that's fair to say, about talking much - since his Philadelphia speech, which was brilliant and really helpful - he's been reticent to talk much about race. You know, and he's being, you know, he's sometimes being attacked from his own Democratic base about not talking enough about it."", ""I do think it is because he is - has this biracial background and because he is so sensitive on this issue, and he has such a keen understanding of it, that it would be constructive for him to talk more about it, to deal more fully with it, because it's out there. It's something which the country really has to pull together on. And I think, could help us understand the people of biracial backgrounds - because we have an increasing number in our society. Again, it's all - this is about all of us becoming one family."", ""I've got about one minute, literally, left. Maria, since you're a radio person, I know you can appreciate that. I will come to you to get your quick response, and then Leonard, and then we're going to close out."", ""Really, with a minute, oh, my God. On this issue, you're kidding."", 'Actually, less than that.', 'But I think that...', ""You know what, the president is also the child of an immigrant. I wish he would talk a little bit more about that so that we could also realize that that is who we are. And then, if we, again, at least open up the conversation about who we are, where we come from and the fact that we all - unless we're Native American - we were - we have come to this place - so, I think that, yeah, a conversation around that would be good. And you know what else, having more of these kinds of conversations for longer would be even better."", ""You're absolutely correct. Leonard, you're going to get the last word, and I'm going to throw this out at you because I think - and you tell me if I'm wrong about this - if Barack Obama were to deny his blackness to say that he was white or he was something other than that, his black constituency would have a fit, wouldn't it?"", ""They would be in an uproar. Even, I believe, if he said that he was biracial. The thing - two things. I'll try to make these points very quickly. One, we're all biracial to some degree in this country. I mean, that's just the history. My great, great grandmother was Irish or - whatever that does for me. The other thing is that I think that what Barack Obama has done, like a lot of people of black and white heritage, is make the calculation, which side of this heritage defines how I'm treated in the world. And he's obviously made a choice that it's the brown - that it's the African-American side."", ""Thank you all very much for an enlightening conversation. Maria Hinojosa, host and managing editor of NPR's Latino USA; Leonard Pitts, Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated columnist for The Miami Herald; and David Gergen, professor of public service and the director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. We will try to do this again. I think it's valuable. Do you agree? You all agree?"", 'Oh, certainly.', ""I'm on it."", 'Absolutely.', 'Absolutely.

Political leaders and other dignitaries from across the political spectrum gathered to mourn McCain, who died last Saturday at his ranch in Arizona after ending treatment for brain cancer. Along with mourning the loss, though, they came to celebrate together McCain's four-plus decades of public service. The sprawling cathedral has been the site of many major events, including inaugural prayer services and memorials for presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan."", ""NPR's Kelsey Snell was there, and she has this report."", ""Even in death, John McCain wanted to send America a message. And, after a week of remembrances and celebrations, the event at Washington National Cathedral was as much a memorial as a challenge to America's political leaders to abandon petty squabbles and focus on national service.

She is resourceful and confident and secure. She meets her responsibilities. She speaks quietly because she is strong. America does not boast because she has no need to. The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.', 'She was the first to speak, and it set the tone for the next two and a half hours. Speakers, including former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, honored John McCain as a father, a naval aviator, a senator and as a statesman.

Former President Barack Obama repeated the theme as he, like Meghan McCain, made veiled references to President Trump and an era of politics that have grown coarse.', 'So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty, trafficking in bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage.', ""The message was not a mistake. McCain personally orchestrated this week. He asked friends and rivals to remember him honestly, not just fondly. And they did. They spoke of bitter battles over policy and McCain's famously salty language as often as they talked of his warmth and humor. Former President George W. Bush told stories about their hard-fought political history. He said McCain was sometimes frustrating, but beneath their intense clashes was respect.

He served first as a Navy pilot, flying bombing missions in Vietnam. He was a prisoner of war for five and a half years and carried the scars of torture until he died. He served in Congress and in the Senate and ran twice for president and lost. The stories told in his memorial centered mainly on his ability to return from adversity, both personal and political. For Meghan McCain, remembering that spirit means emulating her father's advice on how to mark his death."", 'When my father got sick (sobbing), and I asked him what he wanted me to do with this eulogy, he said, show them how tough you are.', 'John McCain will be buried Sunday in a private service on the grounds of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.', 'Kelsey Snell, NPR News, Washington.']","['MICHEL MARTIN, HOST', 'MICHEL MARTIN, HOST', 'KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE', 'MEGHAN MCCAIN', 'KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE', 'KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE', 'KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE', 'MEGHAN MCCAIN', 'KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE', 'KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE']"

This began in mid-February. What began as a series of peaceful protests I don't think anybody could've imagined would come to this."", 'Eventually, one week after these started, Gadhafi finally came on air looking distraught, gave a rambling, rambling speech that seemed half mad from the barracks that had been bombed by the U.S. and then he cracked down.', ""This is special coverage of the allied military action in Libya.

But before earlier, we were talking about what had happened, how we got to this point. Just a short time ago, a few years ago, Moammar Gadhafi became a reformed leader, a leader that used to support terrorism and then all of the sudden became embraced by the West - by Britain, by the United States, Italy and others - and it all seems to be crumbling in a snap."", ""Well, it makes me smile that you say he was embraced by the West. I think he was embraced by the Western oil companies. Everyone wanted to go back in and get at his oil resources, despite the fact he'd had a long checkered career and indulged in terrorism - the Lockerbie Pan Am one that he blew up, had blown up by two of his agents, other attacks."", 'Nightclub bombing in Berlin and...', ""And, you know, one goes back to this sort of, you know, tiger changed his stripes. And Gadhafi, you know, played the game for the West because he wanted to get away from sanctions. The West was very happy to get into oil. It was a marriage of convenience, but a dangerous one, as we're seeing."", ""I guess it's worth noting, despite all of this eccentricity which has been well chronicled, he was regarded by many in sub-Saharan Africa as a hero."", ""Well, yes and no. I mean, he lavished a lot of money. He used his oil money to buy friends. He (unintelligible) a lot in Africa. He turned away from the Mideast about being a Middle Eastern leader and decided he was an African leader and had visions of actually being the king of kings of Africa and uniting Africa under his guidance. It fell apart and didn't happen and he ended up back just running Libya."", 'And, of course, we talked about how he travels with tents and his guards of women and other things. But ultimately, many reports that he really is truly a brutal leader, I mean, attacking his own population.', ""Well, if we've needed any evidence of that we've seen it in the last three weeks. I mean, he's used every means possible to subdue the rebellion against. He's used aircraft; he's used artillery, tanks, missiles. He's unleashed all of his firepower on rebels who are basically were demonstrators who picked up a few guns and have no real military organization or capability."", ""Rachel Martin, our Pentagon correspondent is back here in the studio with me. She's been, of course, following developments out of the Pentagon. Rachel, the Pentagon has, of course, confirmed the U.S. missile attacks. Do we have a better sense of what they are targeting?"", ""At this point, Guy, what we know is that they are targeting in this first phase of the operation the air defense systems in Libya. This is what has to happen before the skies could be secured. And you'll remember Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said this a couple of weeks ago."", 'He said this is a military intervention.', ""We saw French fighter jets in the skies of Libya earlier today. We're now seeing U.S. missiles in Libyan airspace. More than 100 tomahawk missiles have been launched over 20 targets that they're pursuing."", ""As we've heard from David Greene in Tripoli and Eric Westervelt near Benghazi before he was cut off - and we'll try to get him back on the line - they have not seen or heard any signs of airstrikes or attacks. But more than 100 or 100 cruise missiles sounds like a lot. I mean, do we have a sense of how widespread this is?"", ""As far as where they're stretching..."", 'Yeah.', ""So, at the same time understanding that Tripoli is an incredibly important area to secure, the idea that this has to be incredibly surgical, that they're going after very tactical locations, wanting to take every precaution to make sure that they don't disenfranchise any more of the population, those who are supporting Gadhafi at this point."", ""Rachel, what, I mean, you mentioned Secretary of Defense Gates just a few weeks ago at a congressional hearing essentially staking his position it seemed, saying, look, let me be clear. This is a military intervention. A no- fly zone isn't just a bunch of airplanes flying in the sky preventing Libyan planes from flying up there; it starts with a military campaign. It seems clear that he was saying - if you read between the lines - that he was saying this isn't a good idea."", ""You know, I don't want to put words in the secretary's mouth, but from all of my observation of his posture throughout this, it just seems that this is not something that he personally wanted to get involved with. He is one foot out the door at this point in his tenure. I think he sees the danger of being involved as the United States in a third war in a Muslim country. He was being very, very cautious about how this was going to take place, if at all. And..."", 'And it seems clear that the U.S. military is comfortable, perfectly happy, to let the French and the British and perhaps other countries take the lead.', ""Completely. And it's worth noting that the secretary of defense just changed his itinerary. That he was supposed to be on a trip today - I was supposed to be with him on a plane right now to Russia - changed that. But, you know, it's worth noting that he was going to fly to Russia. This is not Libya. This is not the Middle East. It's not germane to what we're talking about today, but at the last minute they decided that publicly it wasn't a good idea to have him, the symbolism wasn't appropriate."", ""That's NPR's Pentagon correspondent Rachel Martin who's following the developments out of the Defense Department.

You lived there until you were a teenager and you've been back, I understand, nearly every year since.

But all the calls that we made and these stories that came out from (unintelligible) tells us that the killing has been horrific."", ""Professor Ahmida, it seems - and, again, I say it seems - but based on these attacks, it seems clear that the international community now is voting with its military forces in backing the opposition, the anti-Gadhafi opposition. We've been hearing for weeks - months I should say - that his days are numbered. He has managed to survive this long. What is your sense? Do you believe his days are numbered, especially now?"", ""On the other hand, we have, you know, people going to the streets, liberating many cities. But in turn, Libyan National Congress, you know, (unintelligible) in Benghazi, Libya hasn't really trained or equipped or prepared for this really onslaught by the state. So, we have, you know, a crisis. In one sense, a regime that's not legitimacy and other hand civilians who are having enthusiasm and with the streets as they are not able to face this machine."", ""Professor Ahmida, we're getting some reports that Gadhafi is speaking or has made a statement saying that the interests of the Mediterranean of North African countries will be in danger from now on. It's not clear what that means. But I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of who supports them. Because so often when we speak with Libyans, ex-pats here in the U.S. and in Europe, these are the voices of the opposition, the anti-Gadhafi voices."", ""That's right."", 'So, who does back him?', ""Now, who's still supporting him, Guy? I think now what he has is for some (unintelligible) group, some groups from central and south part of the country, the revolutionary committees and also some supporters from African countries as well who he has financed and helped like that from Chad, from Somalia and from Niger."", 'Professor Ahmida, we\'ll have to leave it there.

That tank column was just destroyed.', 'Those images, yeah.', 'Now, as for Bosnia, their NATO airstrikes were definitive. And I think the reason that they were definitive is because you had two entities that were able to take advantage of them - the Croats and the Serbs.

But you had those other two armies ready to take advantage.', 'Tom Gjelten, in the last minute and a half or so that we have here, give us a sense of how you see this story evolving over the coming days.', ""Well, Guy, I think one of the points that we've seen today, which is very important and interesting, is we heard all along this was not going to be, or we've heard in the last day, this was not going to be a U.S.-led operation."", 'right.', ""Well, today it was a U.S.-led operation and it will be a U.S.-led operation for the next couple of days. What we've seen it seems is that only the United States has the assets and the capabilities to command and control the taking down an air and defense system.

They'll retreat back to Tripoli and Sirte, his hometown, which are his two main big bastions. What happens after that, I don't know. Does someone in his entourage turn against him and shoots him or does he just hang in there and come back to haunt us another day?"", ""And you're listening to continuing coverage of the military action in Libya.

On the other hand, it speaks of raising an additional $1 trillion in revenue. What is this? Is it a tax increase? Is it a tax decrease? Is it tax neutral?"", ""Well, it's actually a tax reform plan and we've taken the framework of the Simpson-Bowles approach, the president's deficit commission, that said if we are willing to be bold with tax expenditures, tax loopholes, tax deductions and cut them back fairly dramatically, we can actually lower rates and still generate additional revenues for deficit reduction."", 'For example - and I was a governor before being senator and I was a business guy - you know, federal government accounting is a little bit screwy. One of the things that we get rid of is the alternative minimum tax, the so-called AMT, which over a 10-year period saves 1.7 trillion, yet each year we patch it. So the fact that we get rid of it does save us money, counts as a tax relief, but you can score it different ways based upon different baselines.', ""That's pretty much gobbledy-gook to most of our listeners, but there - let me assure you that this has been a plan that has been vetted for months in terms of the framework of Simpson-Bowles."", ""Well, let me cut to the chase. Did your Republican colleagues tell you that they think Republicans in the House can look at what you've done and say it squares with their view on taxes? They've been adamant on that."", ""Well, I think they think it can because within the confines of certain pledges, because there are this tax reduction on things that, frankly, we don't pay for each year or we avoid actually following the law each year the way Congress does budgeting, you know, we can generate revenues and still make sure that - within the framework of some of these so-called pledges, I think it passes that muster."", '(unintelligible)', ""At the end of the day, what the American people need to look at is - will our debt, the amount of money that we owe foreigners, and our investors and our own folks who own bonds, will we owe less debt 10 years from now if we have this plan? We will owe close to $4 trillion less debt than what we would owe if we do nothing. That's what the bottom line, as a former business guy, that's the way I'd look at this plan."", ""One of cuts is eliminating the so-called Class Act, that's a provision of the new health care law that addresses at-home long term care. This was a favorite project of the late Senator Edward Kennedy. Are your fellow Democrats prepared to jettison that?"", ""Listen, there are a number of people who fought very hard for the Class Act. In concept, it makes sense. The problem with the aging of our population is to add a big new entitlement that for the first 10 years doesn't cost that much, but in the out years, really would be extraordinarily costly. We thought at this moment of tight deficits we couldn't promise folks this new entitlement if we couldn't pay for it 10 or 15 years from now, 20 years from now."", ""And I'm sure there will be some pushback. There's things in this plan for everybody to like, in terms of deficit reduction, but there's also things that everybody will dislike."", ""That's a big Democratic give, that one, you're saying. What is this, by the way? It's not a bill. It must be umpteen bills. It calls upon the Senate Finance Committee to get to work on a tax reform. What exactly is it that would go to the Congress that somebody could vote on and President Obama could sign?"", ""Well, the first thing we've got to make sure is that we raise the debt limit. And with time so short, what we can't do - even though, I think this is a great plan - that we can jeopardize raising that debt limit. That would be catastrophic. A downgrade of our debt would be a tax increase on every American in terms of higher interest costs. So, that's got to be our first objective."", ""The second objective is actually having a process to reduce our debt by this close to $4 trillion. We break it into two steps, one bill that would make a down payment and set up the process on how we get the balance of this close to $4 trillion. This gives us a two-step plan that we've laid out, whether it can be implemented into legislative language in the 12 or 13 days we've got left, that's an open question. But we've sure as heck got enough support and this was bipartisan enough..."", 'In the Senate.', ""...and it's bold enough that I think it could gain some traction."", 'Senator Warner, thank you very much.', 'Thank you.', 'Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, one of the so-called Gang of Six.']","['MICHELE NORRIS, Host', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, Host', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, Host', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, Host', 'MARK WARNER', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, Host', 'MARK WARNER', 'MARK WARNER', 'MARK WARNER', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, Host', 'MARK WARNER', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, Host', 'MARK WARNER', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, Host', 'MARK WARNER', 'MARK WARNER', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, Host', 'MARK WARNER', 'MARK WARNER', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, Host', 'MARK WARNER', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, Host', 'MARK WARNER', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, Host']"

And it came out of the nuclear talks, but they were kept on a very different tract and kept secret. They were led by a State Department official named Brett McGurk. He was meeting with Iranians in secret in Switzerland. And by the way, some of these Americans were picked up while these talks were taking place. The Iranians were asking for many Iranian nationals to be released from prison here.

And the U.S. held off on this announcement until they got the American prisoners out. On the settlement issue, Iran's going to receive $400 million plus $1.3 billion in interest.

NPR's counterterrorism correspondent Dina Temple-Raston is with us now. And Dina, the FBI had a press conference in San Bernardino this afternoon and provided some new details. What else have we learned?"", ""Well, officials said they have evidence that both Syed Farook and  Tashfeen Malik had been radicalized for some time. They didn't say how long or by who. They said they have evidence that both Farook and his wife went to shooting ranges a number of times, the latest being just days before the attacks. And they said that the guns used in the attacks were purchased legally. The FBI said Farook bought two pistols and a rifle which authorities found in their apartment.

Did investigators talk about that?"", ""Well, the FBI said that it doesn't have a sense of who was in control of the attack.

But they aren't releasing that yet."", 'And the investigation has been going on for five days now. Has the FBI ruled anything out at this point?', ""Well, they said they don't see anything that suggests a plot coming from outside the U.S. But law enforcement sources told NPR that one of the investigative avenues they're pursuing is whether Malik may have come to the U.S. with the intention to attack, as some sort of honeypot. The question they're trying to answer is whether she purposely trolled matchmaking sites on the web to find up lovelorn American so she could get into the U.S. and do something like what happened last week."", ""Now, I should stress that investigators haven't found anything that suggests this is the case, but again, they want to rule that out.

But the FBI's focusing now on two other people. The first is a childhood friend of Farook's who went to high school with him, and they used to fix cars together. And the two assault rifles were used in the attack - that were used in the attack belong to him."", ""And authorities are questioning Farook's mother as well. She lived in the same house with Farook and Malik and their 6-month-old daughter. So authorities say it's hard to believe that she couldn't have known what was going on given the amount of ammunition and explosives that were in the house. But we don't have details on that yet."", 'There was early reports that this might have been some kind of workplace incident.

It's the subject of his book, Presidents of War.","['The founders of this country designed Congress to constrain presidential powers. And when it came to war, the drafters of the Constitution did not want that consequential decision in the hands of just one person. Among them was James Madison. Presidential historian Michael Beschloss says when Madison became president himself, he learned that wars can reap political benefits. Steve Inskeep spoke to Beschloss about his new book. It is titled, ""Presidents Of War.""', ""Madison was the one who said men are not angels. He was so worried of a president who had bad judgment or would try to get us involved in a war for political reasons, he was trying to slam the door on that. But once he was president, in 1812, he's the one who opened the door to a president going to Congress and saying, I think there should be a war. And if you hadn't had Madison do that, it might have been a much longer time before presidents could make war almost single-handedly."", 'What was the situation that the United States faced in 1812?', 'The United States had ships that were being harassed by the British. A lot of Americans wanted to grab Canada. So there was a group in Congress...', 'Which was British Canada then. OK.', ""Absolutely. So they said, how 'bout a war? And Madison said, well, you know, maybe there is a good rationale for having a war. And Madison sort of liked the idea being a war president himself, exactly the opposite of the way he was in 1787 in Philadelphia."", ""I'm thinking of that old saying that where you stand is determined by where you sit. When he was sitting in what we now call the White House, he started seeing things differently than he had before."", ""Perfect way of putting it. And Madison also knew that it would be politically useful to him in 1812 - he was running for re-election - to have a war that he was the biggest advocate of. Sounds pretty modern doesn't it?"", ""So James Madison is one of the presidents who gives the president a role in war-making, although they're still asking Congress at that point."", 'Absolutely.', ""Let's go ahead a few decades. James K. Polk is president of the United States in the 1840s. What'd he do?"", ""Well, James K. Polk was a liar and a cheat and a bully, and he wanted the United States to have a big war with Mexico. And his hidden agenda was he wanted to get New Mexico, he wanted to get California - which were owned by Mexico at that time - a lot of other land, and add it to the United States. In 1846, he sent American troops down to the Texas border to provoke the Mexicans. The Mexicans fought back. And Polk says, look, there's been this terrible attack on us by Mexico. We need a big war. Congress gladly gave it to him."", 'I guess we should just explain this a little more. He sent troops into disputed territory between the U.S. and Mexico, right?', 'He did. And the result was Polk had essentially fabricated an incident that would allow him to go to Congress and say we need a big war with Mexico.', 'But wait a minute here. He still had to ask Congress. Congress still had to act. How did senators respond when they were challenged by this guy who was essentially taking their authority away?', 'Many senators said that Polk is trying to cheat him. They questioned the reason that we were going to war, but they voted for this war overwhelmingly and set the pattern for the future.', 'Why did they do that?', ""They knew that the war would be popular. They knew that many people would say, the Mexicans attacked us, why aren't we fighting back? It would be very hard for them to say no, and that was a pattern that lasted into the future."", 'OK. But still at that time in history, Congress was declaring war. The president would ask. Congress would do it. If we go ahead a century, to around 1950, Harry S. Truman is the president of the United States. What happened in 1950?', ""I love Truman, Steve, but he did a terrible thing in 1950. The North Koreans attacked the South in June of 1950, and what Truman should have done under the Constitution, he should have gone to Congress and said, I'd like a war declaration. They would have given it to him. But Truman was terrified that there'd be a big debate where he might be criticized and it might undermine him in the midterm elections of 1950."", ""So Truman didn't even bother going to Congress. He said, I'm doing this as a police action under the United Nations. I don't need a declaration. And the result of that was that Lyndon Johnson, in 1964 when he wanted his war in Vietnam, said, Truman didn't ask Congress. I don't have to do it, either."", ""And we've never had a declaration of war since."", 'Not since 1942, and that is totally in violation of the Constitution.', ""What are some of the consequences of this evolution increase, really, in presidential power when we look at the last, I don't know, 20, 30 years?"", ""The result is a modern president nowadays can start a war almost single-handedly, and most of them are tempted because they know that if you've got political problems and you get the United States into a war that is popular, your poll ratings will rise."", 'You write early in this book, were the founders to come back, they would probably be astonished and chagrined to discover that in spite of their ardent strivings, the life or death of much of the human race has now come to depend on the character of the single person who happens to be president of the United States.', ""The founders knew that almost anyone could become president, and they didn't want all of our security to rest on whoever happened to get that job."", 'When you wrote that line recently, did you have any particular individual in mind?', ""President Trump has often talked about starting wars for political reasons. In 2011, he tweeted, President Obama's going to start a war with Iran in order to get re-elected. President Trump..."", 'He predicted that President Obama would do that, which did happen.', ""But he makes the connection between war and politics that the founders never wanted to see a president make. The other thing is that, like other presidents, President Trump has remarked on the fact that oftentimes if you want to be considered a great president, it's easier to do that if you've been commander-in-chief during war. That is a thought that our founders would never have wanted to hear from any president."", ""One other recent episode I want to ask about. President Obama in 2013 seemed on the verge of launching an attack against Syria because of Syria's use of chemical weapons..."", ""I'm ready to act in the face of this outrage. Today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move forward together as one nation."", ""...And specifically said, I'm not going to do that without the approval of Congress. It's seen as a serious mistake in foreign policy. It left Bashar Assad of Syria with much more freedom. Would you argue that it was the right choice, even though it seems to have been a mistake?"", ""I think it is always the right choice for a president never to get into a war unless he's got Congress in with him on the takeoff. He belatedly saw that that was not going to be possible, and that's why he pulled back."", 'Michael Beschloss is the author of, ""Presidents Of War: The Epic Story From 1807 To Modern Times.""

NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with UCLA law professor Adam Winkler about why changing U.S. gun policy is more difficult.,"[""Ban them. There is no place for them. We have heard very similar sentiments from people here in the U.S. after mass shootings, but it's not nearly as easy to change gun laws in this country. To talk about why that is, we reached out to Adam Winkler. He's a law professor at UCLA. Welcome."", 'Thanks so much for having me.', ""As we just heard a few minutes ago, the prime minister of New Zealand announces this ban on military-style semiautomatic weapons less than one week after the mass shooting that left 50 people dead. And when Ardern made the announcement, she emphasized that in New Zealand, gun ownership is a privilege, not a right, which is obviously not the case here. So let's just start with that very important difference between the two countries."", ""Well, I don't think that is the difference that explains why America is not moving on gun control. The difference is really the political power of the gun rights movement in America. The Second Amendment certainly plays an important role in shaping cultural attitudes about guns and forming American politics about guns. But the courts haven't used the Second Amendment to strike down lots of laws. And most courts have upheld the kinds of laws that New Zealand is considering, such as bans on high-capacity magazines and bans on military-style rifles. The problem is the NRA won't let those laws be passed in America."", ""I'm curious. Can you talk about a couple of recent examples where it seemed like there was substantial momentum in this country to change gun laws but then nothing ended up happening?"", 'Well, right after the Newtown shooting, President Obama put the weight of the presidency behind gun control efforts to get universal background checks.', ""There's no reason why we can't get that done. That is not a liberal idea or a conservative idea. It's not a Democratic or Republican idea. That is a smart idea. We want to keep those guns out of hands of folks who shouldn't have them."", 'And that failed in the Senate.', ""I'm going to speak plainly and honestly about what's happened here because the American people are trying to figure out, how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen?"", ""And that really put a damper on future federal gun control efforts. We've also seen, after Las Vegas, that there was a move to pass a federal law banning bump stocks."", 'We have now witnessed the deadliest mass shooting in United States history - nearly 60 killed and more than 500 injured. Those numbers are simply stunning.', ""But members of Congress didn't want to be on record voting in favor of gun control, and so Congress kicked it to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms."", ""Let's talk about the NRA - the National Rifle Association - which obviously has tremendous influence here in the U.S. New Zealand has groups like the NRA, but they don't have nearly the same kind of power. Can you explain - how does the NRA exert its tremendous influence here?"", ""Well, everyone thinks the NRA is so powerful because it's so rich and it does so much lobbying. And those are important aspects of the NRA's power, but we shouldn't underestimate how the NRA brings voters out on Election Day. And in a democracy, if you can sway voters - and there are a lot of single-issue, pro-gun voters that follow the NRA - you're going to be a powerful political force in elections."", 'Now, both the U.S. and New Zealand have robust gun cultures, but why do you think gun owners here seem more resistant to changes in gun control laws?', ""Well, it could be the role of the Second Amendment in shaping cultural attitudes and opinions about gun rights. For the last 40 years or so, the NRA has been very active in promoting a vision of the Second Amendment that suggests that any law that restricts guns is a violation of that right, almost the kind of way that we sometimes - First Amendment rights - that any restriction on speech is a fundamental affront to the First Amendment. That kind of absolutist approach, though, doesn't create a lot of space for reform or compromise."", 'Do you feel like the American gun culture is unique?', ""The American gun culture is pretty unique. I mean, it comes out of the unique circumstances of America and our federalist system, which has also, historically, prevented a lot of gun legislation from being adopted. But the NRA is busy exporting its idea of gun rights and has been active in New Zealand. But it hasn't really taken hold, as evidenced by the fact that even the main opposition groups in New Zealand have already signaled that they're going to support this new gun reform."", 'Adam Winkler is a law professor at UCLA.

And members of Congress are facing hostile crowds at town halls back in their districts.","['FBI Director James Comey is out. But the investigations into Russian meddling continue.', ""At least a Senate intelligence committee investigation continues. The committee subpoenaed records from former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who, as you may recall, was fired for lying about his contacts with Russia. The future of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling is not known. James Comey told senators he was seeking more money for that probe soon before he was dismissed. Former CIA Director Leon Panetta is telling Rachel today that he doubts President Trump's reasons for Comey's firing."", ""I think this is a little bit of a game of looking for reasons to probably dismiss the FBI director because that's what the president wanted to do."", ""But for now, the department is in the hands of acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who will take Comey's place in an intelligence committee hearing today."", 'OK, so lots of questions to work through this morning. To help us do that, we are joined by NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Good morning, Scott.', 'Morning, Rachel.', 'So is a special investigation looking more likely this morning?', ""You know, honestly, at the moment, it's not looking that much more likely than it was at the beginning of the week. You know, Democrats are calling for this in near unison. And a handful of Republicans are as well. That number's growing. But the key thing to make that happen would be Republican leaders getting onboard with the idea, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan. And as of yesterday, both of them said no."", ""They continue to have confidence in the House and Senate intelligence committee investigations and, even in the wake of Comey's firing, the FBI investigation. But, you know, public opinion can change fast on that. And I think people like Ryan and McConnell are always monitoring it. They could change their minds. At the moment, they just haven't."", 'Even some Republicans are saying at this point that President Trump himself needs to get in front of a microphone and explain to the American people why he fired James Comey. Any signs that that might happen?', ""Well, Rachel, it's President Trump. So you never know what the next Twitter push notification is going to bring you. So he could, but at the moment, all we have is a brief statement he gave in the Oval Office yesterday, saying that Comey just wasn't doing a good job. The White House's timeline has shifted a bit on this. They're now saying that President Trump had lost confidence in Comey over the course of months but that this really came to a head Monday and Tuesday, when he met with the attorney general and deputy attorney general and discussed the issue."", 'But, you know, NPR and other outlets were told from Hill staffers yesterday that just before Comey was fired, he had asked for additional resources for the Russia investigation. That is something the Justice Department is denying, though.', 'All right. So meanwhile, the congressional hearings are pushing forward. The Senate intelligence committee, investigating Russian interference in the election, issued a subpoena for records from former national security adviser Michael Flynn. What are they looking for?', ""It was a pretty broad request for all documents related to their inquiry. But this is a big deal. It's a sign the Senate investigation is getting more aggressive. Up until now, they had only been making informal requests for appearances, not subpoenas. And a lot of the investigation had been kind of passive, just taking in the information the FBI was bringing to them. So an independent subpoena I think is a pretty significant deal that the Senate is stepping things up."", ""Let's bear in mind that a moment is coming up where critics or people who are concerned about Comey's firing will have some leverage because when President Trump names Comey's replacement, he needs to get Senate confirmation. You need 51 votes in the Senate. Republicans do have 52, but a bunch of them - several of them, anyway - have expressed grave concerns. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Senator John McCain, Susan Collins, several others are raising questions here. And they will have an opportunity to raise them as that process goes forward."", ""OK, so Scott, stick with us because we're going to stay in the realm of the political. Americans are still trying to process the president's decision to fire James Comey and what it all means. Some of that processing was rather intense at a particular town hall last night."", ""Oh, yeah. It was a meeting called by Republican Congressman Tom MacArthur. He's in New Jersey, represents New Jersey. He is an architect of an amendment that saved the Republican health care bill in the House. He was all over the news - the MacArthur amendment. And then last night, for more than four hours, he faced questions about the health care plan as well as the firing of the FBI director. Here's voter Kimberly Stewart (ph)."", 'We seem to have a pattern that most people who are investigating it seem to be getting fired.', ""Do you support an independent group investigating Russia's ties into the 2016 election?"", ""OK, and Detrow's pulling double duty for us because you were there - right, Scott? - at this town hall. Did things start out pretty tense? Or did it build over those four hours?"", 'Oh, it started off tense right off the bat. I think we all got a sense of what the mood was going to be like when MacArthur started talking about a daughter who died at age 11 from serious medical issues. And the room started to boo him and jeer him, saying that he was using her as a shield when it came to health care issues. I mean, that gets tense pretty quickly.', ""This was a Democratic part of MacArthur's district. He repeatedly pointed that out. But a lot of people had very specific concerns about his key role in getting this health care bill past the House. MacArthur said that what he's trying to do here is save the current health care system."", 'So was this primarily about health care? I mean, we heard that clip about the the Russia investigations. At what point did that come in?', 'For two hours, the only questions - I kept track of this. It was health care, Russia, health care, Russia - just going back and forth between those two questions. Nothing else was asked about until flood insurance more than two hours into the - into the hearing. But a lot of...', ""Didn't MacArthur express great relief, Scott Detrow - finally, some question other than Russia, health care?"", ""He did. He said, I'd love to talk about something else, you know, at hour three of this meeting. But you know, a lot of people came up and told very personal stories about health struggles they had, about the fact that a spouse had, you know, breast cancer or something like that. And they said, I'm just terrified that if I lose insurance and lose my job, I'm going to have to pay more for a preexisting condition because of the language you've put into place. He repeatedly said that is not the case, that this will not take away preexisting conditions. But as we've reported, you know, people with preexisting conditions could, under certain circumstances, pay a lot more for health care under this bill that just passed."", ""So Scott, do these town halls change minds. I mean, they've been getting so much attention in recent months. Are they just an opportunity to vent? How do Congress members see - see these things?"", ""You know, they're a real imperfect measurement of public opinion. But I think what they can tell us is who is enthusiastic and engaged enough to take the time to, you know, spend five hours yelling at a congressman. And I think that can tell you who might show up at the polls. One thing that struck me is how informed and detailed these questions are. We often think that voters aren't paying close attention to Congress, a lot of details about amendments, a lot of details about investigations here. I was - I was impressed at the detail of the questions."", 'And it is energizing when, in cases like this, politics becomes for people a participatory sport.', '(Laughter). So thanks so much. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Thanks as always, Scott.', 'Thank you.', ""And we're going to move from politics to bullying, which - let's be honest, Steve - may not be such a big leap."", ""Sad but true. We're talking here, though, about the kind of bullying that happens in the schoolyard. A recent study in the journal Pediatrics examined bullying. And researchers followed more than 100 schools in Maryland for this study over a decade. And they concluded that bullying is much less accepted than it was."", 'NPR education reporter Anya Kamenetz is on the story. Hi, Anya.', 'Hi, Rachel.', ""Bullying isn't - is less accepted? Is this just wishful thinking? I imagine you're going to tell me that there's some data here."", 'Yes, absolutely. So this is an annual survey in the state of Maryland. And many states are adopting similar kinds of school climate surveys. And they asked students, in the last 30 days, has something happened to you, like pushing and shoving, rumors, cyberbullying? And the incidents dropped so dramatically - 28.5 percent in 2005 down to 13 and - 13.4 percent in 2014, which is the last year - so more than half over a decade.', ""So I'm going to ask you why. But first, how are they - bullying can be a whole lot of things. And you mentioned a couple. But was there a specific definition of what bullying is in this?"", ""Well, I mean, it's up to the students' interpretation. And it might be different in fourth grade than 12th grade. But they tried to arrange it across, you know, the physical behaviors that might be more common among boys, over to the sort of relational forms of bullying, like rumors - spreading rumors or saying something negative, insulting people. But it was - really was a wide range. And, you know, specifically, they asked, did you experience this yourself in the last month."", 'So the big question - why, why the change?', ""Yes. So Catherine Bradshaw, one of the authors of the study, she's a dean at the University of Virginia. And she has been studying the evidence-based practices that she says are leading to this positive social change. So what we've seen and particularly in the last administration, we heard that the Obama administration really used their bully pulpit as well as funding research."", 'Bully pulpit.', 'Did you just say that? You said that.', 'I did, yes. Oh, no.', 'OK, please, continue - bully for you.', 'Oh, no I did not think about that (laughter).', 'Keep going.', 'So to try to spread the word, spread the message that we can do better, and we will do better. In fact, Obama participated in a social media campaign called, It Gets Better, which was for LGBT youth. And I think we have some sound of that. Is that right?', ""Let's listen to it."", ""We've got to dispel this myth that bullying is just a normal rite of passage, that it's some inevitable part of growing up. It's not."", 'Right, so...', 'So the president saying, it gets better, and apparently it has.', ""Well, exactly. And so it's interesting because the researchers are cautious. They don't want to over-interpret this. Or - you know, it's hard to talk about positive social change, I guess."", ""Sounds like a good step in the right direction. NPR's Anya Kamenetz.

Next week they return to battling over hot buttons like NAFTA.,"[""It's been a weekend of remembering old Washington, a place of principled disagreement, honesty and mutual respect. At least that's the romantic myth. And at John McCain's funeral yesterday, that was also the reality as friends and colleagues paid tribute to the late senator. NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson, is with us to talk about that and the week ahead. Good morning, Mara."", 'Good morning, Melissa.', 'The ceremonies for John McCain started in Phoenix, moved on to the U.S. Capitol. And then yesterday, we saw his funeral at the National Cathedral. Today, his private burial in Annapolis at the Naval Academy. It has been a remarkable outpouring.', ""A remarkable outpouring. Many people consider John McCain to be the most important politician of his age. He described himself as a flawed individual, like all of us. But he also stood for civility and honor and sacrifice. And considering your political opponents are not your enemies - he was willing to work across the aisle. That's very rare nowadays. And many people feel that this is a moment when a lot of those basic democratic values, along with human decency and character, are really under attack. And that made his funeral even more poignant."", 'Right. And we notably - we heard two former presidents, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, essentially preach about shared values and a common humanity at his funeral.', ""That's right. McCain pointedly invited these two former presidents, former adversaries of his. They both defeated him in presidential elections. He pointedly did not invite the current occupant of the White House. No one mentioned Donald Trump's name yesterday, but the entire service was an implicit rebuke to him. And that's how John McCain planned it. When John McCain's daughter Meghan stood up and said the America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great, she got a huge round of applause. That just doesn't happen at funerals. One writer said the gathering at the cathedral was a giant meeting of the resistance."", ""And that was certainly - that tacit rebuke was certainly a subtext of this part of President Obama's tribute to John McCain. Let's take a listen."", ""So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty - trafficking and bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage. It's a politics that pretends to be brave and tough, when, in fact, it's born of fear."", 'And, Mara, in other circumstances, those words might not have been quite so remarkable.', ""Not quite so remarkable. But also, maybe they wouldn't have to be said. But we're in a first-principles moment in American politics. And we have a president who rejects the traditional role as a unifier in American life. And Barack Obama has said that he wasn't going to get involved in every little political battle in America since he's finished his term in office. But he would speak out when he felt basic democratic values were at risk."", 'Mara, we mentioned that President Trump was literally absent at that funeral. He was at his Virginia golf course during the service at the National Cathedral. But he did tweet while all those dignitaries were gathered.', 'He did tweet about his usual grievances about the FBI and the Department of Justice. But he also tweeted about NAFTA, which is his - one of his most important campaign promises was to renegotiate NAFTA. It\'s a very important policy goal. He says he has a deal with Mexico. Mexico says it\'s an understanding that needs Canada to come along. The president has said that he might just leave Canada out of it. Many members of Congress don\'t agree with that. And the president also tweeted - he said Congress, quote, ""should not interfere with these negotiations, or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely."" It\'s very unclear if he has the legal power to do that.', 'Yeah.', ""But he's got 30 days left, and the negotiations with Canada resume on Wednesday."", ""And briefly, Mara, Senate Republicans are guiding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh toward a lifetime seat on the high court. Hearings start on Tuesday. Democrats are furious that they're not getting access to a lot of records - about 100,000 pages of Cavanaugh's years in the Bush White House."", ""That's right. And no matter what happens with NAFTA or the midterm elections, Donald Trump is on course to reshape not just the Supreme Court but the entire judiciary. He is putting judges and justices on the court at a faster clip than any other previous president. And he is remaking the judiciary in his own conservative image. So Democrats are angry, but they are on their back foot. Very few people think that they can defeat Kavanaugh.

The document addresses many of the promises he made during his campaign.,"[""From the studios of NPR West, this is Day to Day. I'm Madeleine Brand."", ""And I'm Alex Cohen. Coming up, President Obama's plans for withdrawing troops from Iraq."", 'But first, the president sent his budget to Congress today with these words.', 'The budget is more than simply numbers on a page. It is a measure of how well we are living up to our obligations to ourselves and one another. It is a test for our commitment to making America what it was always meant to be: a place where all things are possible for all people.', ""The outlines of this budget show an effort by the president to honor many of his campaign promises. NPR's David Welna is on Capitol Hill and has more. And David, heath care is the headline from this budget, right?"", ""Right, Madeleine. Health care is really the linchpin of this budget in that everything else in it depends on getting handle on exploding health-care costs. But instead of laying out a detailed plan for whittling down those costs while expanding health coverage, President Obama wants a 10-year reserve fund of $635 billion to help underwrite such transformation, since it will likely cost closer to a trillion dollars over that time. And by doing that, he avoids policy fights in Congress right off the bat, and such a fund also makes it harder to argue, as Republicans certainly will, that the nation simply can't afford a health-care overhaul in these tough times. You know, this is a budget that also gives high priority to making higher education more accessible, another campaign promise. And that fits in with Mr. Obama's argument that making these kinds of investments in human capital will pay off in the longer run by making the U.S. workforce more competitive in the global economy."", ""So, with the health care, though, he doesn't provide details, but there are some broad outlines of how he'd pay for it, right?"", 'Yes. There is a plan to pay for it by, one, reducing the premiums paid to insurance companies that participate in Medicare and also by reducing the value of itemized deductions that the highest income earners - those making more than a quarter million dollars - can take.', ""And there's also a plan for the environment, involving cap and trade, right?"", ""Yes, he honors another campaign pledge in this budget, both by spending $15 billion a year over the next decade to develop sustainable energy sources and to have this cap-and-trade system where industries would have to pay to pollute, and the income from that would go to help pay for his making-work-pay tax cut, which he's already proposed."", 'Mm-hmm. And that would be for families earning less than $150,000?', 'Yes. It would be $800 for families with double incomes of $150,000, yes.', 'So, David, listening to the president today, what did you glean as his grand aim, his overarching goal, with this budget?', ""Well, I think its overall aim is to transform a society where wealth has increasingly been concentrated at the top into one where those at the top who make more than a quarter million dollars a year are going to have to fork over a lot more in taxes to help pay for things like universal health-care coverage, revamped energy programs and improved education. It's really kind of a New Deal without quite claiming to be one. One other big feature of this budget is that those who wrote it say it's more honest about spending and revenues than were the budgets submitted President Bush. It actually includes the projected costs of fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it does not count on big revenues from the Alternative Minimum Tax, which only the very wealthiest pay since Congress makes the AMT go away every year for most households who would otherwise have to pay for it. The budget that he proposes contemplates the deficit right now of more than a trillion dollars that he inherited being cut in half by the end of his first four years in office."", ""Thank you, NPR's David Welna at the Capitol.""]","['MADELEINE BRAND, Host', 'ALEX COHEN, Host', 'MADELEINE BRAND, Host', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'MADELEINE BRAND, Host', 'DAVID WELNA', 'MADELEINE BRAND, Host', 'DAVID WELNA', 'MADELEINE BRAND, Host', 'DAVID WELNA', 'MADELEINE BRAND, Host', 'DAVID WELNA', 'MADELEINE BRAND, Host', 'DAVID WELNA', 'MADELEINE BRAND, Host']"

It was a key moment in the fight against ISIS but the Yazidis still suffer.,"['Five years ago today, then-President Barack Obama made a speech from the White House to announce airstrikes. It was a key moment in the fight against ISIS. At the time, militants were tearing across Iraq and Syria.', 'Today, I authorized two operations in Iraq, targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water and facing almost certain death.', 'Those Iraqi civilians were part of a small Yazidi religious minority fleeing genocide. Obama had pulled U.S. troops from Iraq a few years before, and now the U.S. was back in combat.', ""NPR's Jane Arraf has covered the rise and fall of ISIS over the last five years, and she joins us from Irbil in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq."", 'Hi, Jane.', 'Hi, Ari.', ""So five years ago, ISIS took over one-third of Iraq and a huge swath of Syria. U.S.-backed forces captured the last piece of ISIS territory just earlier this year. What's the situation today?"", ""So it's much calmer because ISIS no longer controls territory. Their caliphate is gone. And listening to the Obama announcement, he was talking about the U.S. consulate in Irbil, the city that I'm talking to you from. It's very calm here. It's basically recovered. But you know, five years ago, ISIS was about 30 miles from here. There was even fears in Baghdad, although Baghdad was never taken over by ISIS. But it's taken an incredible toll. That fight against ISIS here took most of three years, and it devastated the cities. It divided communities. And while ISIS no longer holds territory, it is actually still around and still a threat. And there are continuing threats to U.S. interests."", 'With ISIS no longer controlling territory and the Trump administration trying to draw down troops, is there still a role for U.S. forces over there?', ""Well, there apparently is because there are still between 4,000 and 5,000 U.S. forces in Iraq and more than 1,000 in Syria. They conduct airstrikes, but a lot of them are support staff. And there is a U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS here that includes 35 countries. So a lot of that focus is on training local security forces. And I saw some of that training yesterday near Irbil. It included Italian instructors training Kurdish fighters. And then I spoke with the deputy commander of the U.S.-led coalition. He's a British general, Major General Christopher Ghika. And he talked about how the ISIS threat is much different now."", 'At the start, they were a much larger physical force with equipment, but they were underpinned by an ideology and by a momentum created by taking over physical territory. And now the position has been turned really.', ""And it's turned because now there are obviously a lot fewer ISIS fighters in a very broad, wide area. But they're carrying out insurgent-style attacks. They're still a threat but one that Major General Ghika says Iraqi security forces are better able to handle. If you look at the latest report, though, from the Pentagon inspector general, that's more cautious. It says ISIS is solidifying its capabilities as an insurgency in Iraq and actually that it's resurging in Syria."", 'And how are the Yazidis doing, this religious minority group that was targeted for genocide?', ""Yeah, they are still suffering. You know, ISIS - the effect of ISIS in this region was kind of like throwing a grenade. It fragmented communities. It fragmented entire ethnic and religious groups. And the Yazidis were the hardest hit. This was a genocide launched specifically against Yazidis by ISIS. More than a thousand were killed in the massacres near Sinjar Mountain. Six thousand of them were enslaved, many of them used as sex slaves. And there are still almost 2,000 missing. And very little has been done to help them. It's a multi-layered trauma. I mean, imagine people who had relatives killed, who had them enslaved, and then they come back and their homes are destroyed. And most of them are still actually in camps for displaced people here in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. It requires years and years of recovery, perhaps a generation."", ""Just last month, President Trump met with Nadia Murad, the Yazidi woman who won the Nobel Peace Prize.

He has a real disinterest in electoral politics."", ""He doesn't want to be elected in a popular vote is what you're saying (laughter)."", 'I think so.

The position of the U.S. in all of this is unclear. Where does the Trump administration stand?', ""It's ambivalent. Technically, the United States is backing his rival, which is this internationally recognized government in Tripoli.

His campaign is stalled. There's issues of logistics, and he can't apply the same kind of airpower in the Tripoli landscape that he did in the eastern part. But I think we're in for a very protracted campaign and perhaps a stalemate."", 'How worried are you that Libya could explode in an all-out civil war?', ""I'm very worried. There's obviously questions about how much outside states get involved. In the past, during his other campaigns, the United Arab Emirates conducted airstrikes. The French were helping him on the ground with intelligence personnel. So I think the outside support is going to be crucial.

It was just five years ago that Fukushima's power plant melted down, which killed tens of thousands in Japan. So one thing I heard from the Japanese was actually some skepticism about the sincerity of the president's call for this end to nuclear weapons because on one hand, he has this long game and has brokered some nuclear agreements, notably with Iran.

And I think one of the things that we might see as a result of a Brexit is some contagion in Europe, the call for referendum in their own countries..."", 'Is this Ian or Nigel speaking?', ""N. BAXTER: This is Nigel here. One of the problems with the EU is that when you look at it, whilst it's 500 million people, it's hugely important from a trade perspective. It is not functioning very well. It has got no growth. It is completely stagnant. It is a huge unemployment issue. Youth unemployment in places like Spain is approaching 50 percent. We have a huge problem with migration, which is very difficult to deal with under the current rules of this Schengen Agreement. And I wouldn't be surprised if we're not talking about the disintegration of the European Union within the next few years."", ""I. BAXTER: Exactly, and that's what concerns me. Don't forget that whilst the EU is imperfect and has lots of problems that it needs to solve, what it's also done is helped facilitate changes in Europe. For example, when the Eastern Bloc countries came out of the Soviet Union, the European Union provided them with a home that promoted democracy, human rights and market economies. And that has worked."", ""Let me ask this of both of you. I have British friends who say that no matter how close they are to Europe geographically, they - there are just more cultural ties between Britain and the U.S. and Canada and they don't feel an emotional connection to Europe.

BAXTER: The truth is, though, that we, you know, geographically we live in Europe. And these people are our neighbors. And, you know, I want to just pick back up on this question of, you know, keeping the peace and what happens if we leave. You know, on matters of trade, for example, we could see beggar-thy-neighbor kind of policies going on in Europe. And that's not what I want to see. I think cooperation, even though it's a difficult thing, is always going to be better."", 'N. BAXTER: Scott, just to come back on that if I may.', 'Yes, Nigel.', ""N. BAXTER: This is the hysteria that we're starting to get then on trade. So what we're saying is, is a Bloc of countries of which we would have left, which has virtually double the amount of trade to the U.K. that we have to them, is going to enter into a destructive trade war in order to beggar-thy-neighbor, to use Ian's words.

His focus is on promoting African entrepreneurs and getting electricity to rural areas.,"[""President Obama is in Kenya today, the country of his father's birth. He's been pushing the theme Africa is open for business, and America ought to invest, especially in young African entrepreneurs. President Obama held a joint press conference today with the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta. He praised the country's focus on rooting out corruption, but when the presidents were asked about the question of gay rights, there was a clear difference of opinion. Our correspondent Gregory Warner is in Nairobi. Greg, thanks for being back with us."", 'Sure, Scott.', 'What happened?', 'Well, gay rights came up, as it had to, and President Obama was unequivocal. He told reporters that on the issue of gay rights in Africa, he believed in equality under the law.', 'When a government gets in the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread.', ""And actually, he cited as an example his own experience as an African-American with Jim Crow laws. But Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, said that to support gay rights in his country would be an unwelcome imposition."", ""It's very difficult for us to be able to impose on people that which they themselves do not accept."", ""I don't want to be obscure about this, Gregory. In - homosexuality is considered a crime."", ""It is in 38 countries in Africa, so it's certainly an issue. And recently the deputy president said that there was no room for gays in Kenya. He said that in a church. But I will say that the issue is a little more complicated than it can seem from the outside. I'll just give you two quick examples. About three months ago, the high court of Kenya recently delivered a ruling that was celebrated by the gay community. They said gay and lesbian - they ratified a gay and lesbian human rights commission, said that the commission had to be registered even though the government refused. And also this year, the prize-winning Kenyan novelist Binyavanga Wainaina came out publically as gay in a noted blog and later in The Guardian newspaper. And he said he couldn't have done that before, but he can now. And he was criticized, but he was not harmed."", ""So I think that things are changing. But the issue of gay rights really comes up as a polarizing issue in the relation of the West to Africa when it's spun as this imposition of Western values on Africa, and that is so sensitive here. I mean, that's why - the importance of African voices speaking up on this issue."", 'What are some of the diplomatic concerns that the presidents addressed in a county that, after all, has suffered terrorist attacks.', 'Well, as you mentioned, terrorism was one and corruption was another, and actually the relationship between the two. You could see Obama trying to avoid that lecture-y tone. As I just mentioned, he was talking about his own hometown of Chicago and the bad, old days of Al Capone and corruption there. He said, well, you know, we had our corruption, and we got over it, so you can, too.', 'I think that although there are anti-graft initiatives going on in Kenya right now, President Obama noted the fact that there has not been a single prosecution of a high-level corrupt official in Kenya and made the point that that is - sorry - feeding terrorist recruitment. There was a recent survey that found the number one reason that Kenyans join groups like al-Shabab is because of the anti-terror tactics of the police and military, which is a huge issue for the United States, given that the government funding to the Kenyan military is now near $100 million.', ""And the United States and Kenya have a powerful identical interest along these lines, too, don't they?"", ""Right. They're both trying to fight the war on terror, but if the war on terror is actually fueling terrorist recruitment, then that's something this countering-violent-extremism message is trying to look at, of President Obama's."", ""NPR's Greg Warner in Nairobi, thanks so much."", 'Thanks, Scott.']","['SCOTT SIMON, HOST', 'GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE', 'SCOTT SIMON, HOST', 'GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE', 'UHURU KENYATTA', 'SCOTT SIMON, HOST', 'GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE', 'GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE', 'SCOTT SIMON, HOST', 'GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE', 'GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE', 'SCOTT SIMON, HOST', 'GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE', 'SCOTT SIMON, HOST', 'GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE']"

Are they so sure Republicans are going to lose elections over this vote?"", ""Well, you know, Democrats believe this is a politically unpopular vote for Republicans in the places where the majority matters, specifically in the 23 districts that Republicans represent that Hillary Clinton won in the last election. And of those 23, 14 Republicans voted for it; nine voted against it. And you can bet that those 14 Republicans are going to be hearing a lot about that vote as we go into next year's election cycle.

What does that tell us about the road ahead here?', ""He was. And several Senate Republicans did. He's correct. The Senate cannot move forward until they know what the bill is going to cost. I think we can expect a slower, more methodical approach. And at the end, it's likely we're going to see a very different bill. I can't presume to guess what it's going to look like, but I do know two things that we're going to be hearing a lot about in the Senate is they're concerned about what the House does to people with pre-existing conditions. And there's also concerns about what they do to the Medicaid program."", ""You know, one thing that has really interested me is the poll numbers. There's been this rise in popular support for Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act. Does that give Democrats some strength as they try to capitalize and wield some influence as the minority party?"", ""Well, we're going to have a test of that pretty soon. As you well know, there's a special election going on in Georgia, and it's the House seat of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. They've already had the initial runoff. They're going to have the election in June. And this is going to be a real barometer of both Democratic enthusiasm and whether they can win in tough districts. This is a Republican-leaning district. It is also, at this point, the most expensive House race in history. They're getting over a $30 million hurdle, so there's a lot of enthusiasm and interest on both sides there. And it's going to be seen as an early bellwether."", 'This was also a victory for Paul Ryan. Right? Speaker of the House, he needed to deliver a legislative win at this point after promising a repeal and replacement for Obamacare for so long, years. And now he owns this to some degree, as do Republicans. And Paul Ryan in particular is going to have to defend vulnerable House members against all those Democratic attacks that are likely to come in 2018.', 'All right. NPR congressional correspondent with us, Susan Davis - Sue, thanks as always.', 'You bet.', ""And let's turn now to the French presidential election, which is this weekend. And Rachel, it seems like American presidents just can't help themselves."", ""Yeah, right. So you may remember that Donald Trump weighed in on France's presidential election. Last month, he said far-right candidate Marine Le Pen would be the toughest on terrorism. Now President Obama is weighing in. He has officially backed a candidate. He recorded an endorsement for centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron."", 'Because of how important this election is, I also want you to know that I am supporting Emmanuel Macron to lead you forward. En marche. Vive le France.', 'OK. Elle (ph)...', 'En marche.', 'En marche.', ""Eleanor Beardsley is here.

Well, let me see what an American president thinks."", ""(Laughter) No, David, they're not. But I talked to people yesterday who had seen that message, and they were surprised but pleased. And the Macron campaign, you know, really made a lot of it. They tweeted it out. They wanted people to know. He's still very popular here. So symbolically, that was something. And, you know, people here know that the world is following this election. The media talks about it a lot. They've always got foreign journalists saying the candidates' names with their accents. And, you know, after Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, will France now go for a far-right populist? People here know the world is watching."", 'Well, a lot of people were able to watch what sounds like quite a debate the other night between Macron and Marine Le Pen.', 'You know, it was. It was absolutely caustic and just heated and argumentative. The results of that debate are still being debated this morning. The big conclusion is it wasn\'t very presidential for a presidential debate and mostly because critics are saying that Marine Le Pen was just launching brutal attacks the whole time. Her image has actually been worsened by this. You know, she called Mr. Macron a rich banker who wanted to sack and pillage the French people for profits. Monday\'s - I mean, Le Monde\'s headline of the newspaper today says ""Strategy Of Lies,"" and it lays out 19 of her lies. And, you know, analysts say she debated a la Donald Trump, just accusations, insinuations and a lot of interruptions. She even became kind of weird. Listen to - this clip has been going around social media. Listen to this.', '(Speaking French).', '(Speaking French).', '(Speaking French).', ""So she accuses Macron of embracing conspiracy theories there about the far-right being out there in the fields, in the cities. And it's - it was very strange, and she used her hands a lot. And that's been going around social media."", ""Well, so you have a far-right candidate who's saying the far-right is not so scary. You have her opponent who seems like he's winning. What's at stake here this weekend in your mind?"", ""This is just two completely different visions for the future of France. She says, you know, open borders and the E.U. - European Union - have wrecked France's economy. We must close borders, take back our sovereignty, protect people from globalization and immigration. He says, France must engage with the world. That's our traditions - we will be open; we will be competitive."", ""But even with such big differences, people still don't know who to vote for. One in 4 say they can't vote for either - they're going to abstain. And 1 in 5 say that they're still undecided despite mainstream politicians coming out and saying you've got to vote against the far-right. So this is supposed to be an election with one of the highest abstention rates. Only 75 percent of French voters are supposed to come out and vote on Sunday."", ""Which is pretty remarkable considering the central question, which Le Pen supporters have tried to frame as a question about what it means to be French. And of course, all of this is wrapped up in France's immigration debate in that country, how they're assimilating or not assimilating immigrant communities, which sounds a little bit familiar if you think about the U.S. election."", 'Right.', 'Absolutely, Rachel.', ""NPR's Eleanor Beardsley, it's always good to hear your voice, Eleanor. And thank you."", 'Thank you.', ""All right, we're going to leave you this morning with a story about alleged Russian meddling in an election."", ""Yeah. And we're not talking about the U.S. Yesterday, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency reiterated the claim that Russia has been gathering political data in a series of cyberattacks. This is something that came up in the meeting earlier this week between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia typically, as it has done, continues to deny any of this. Germany says it's working to strengthen its own cyber defenses ahead of their election in the fall."", ""Well, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in Berlin. Hey, Soraya."", 'Hey. Good morning.', 'So what did Russia do here?', ""Well, it's accused - actually, we should say Russian hackers who the government claims are not linked to them - the Kremlin claims are not linked - but during three weeks in 2015, they accessed about 20,000 computers in the German Parliament and their constituencies across the country. And it's still unclear this many years later exactly what was stolen, just that they - the fear is that it's going to be used the way - or that the Russians might suddenly decide to use it in the German elections, which are coming up here in the fall, just as they're accused of doing in the American campaign. And at the same time..."", 'Yeah, it sounds sort of similar.', ""Yeah (laughter). German candidates are also worried about Russians using fake news because they've had experience with that in January 2016 when there was a lot of political damage inflicted on Chancellor Merkel because of the fake case of a 13-year-old girl named Lisa who claimed to have been raped by asylum-seekers, and that was proven not to be true at all."", ""Oh, wow. They've got the fake news that they're really - that's troubling. I mean, is Germany confident they can do something about this?"", ""Well, they've already taken some steps, so one thing is that the government has embedded units in all of Germany's security agencies and military to more quickly identify and deal with cyberattacks. On the fake news front, they've introduced a draft bill, which is expected to be voted on by the Lower House of Parliament before the summer recess, that would clamp down on fake news, basically with fines, really hefty ones, up to $54 million on - that will be imposed on social media platforms that carry such items."", ""Wow, it's so interesting."", 'But perhaps the most interesting thing...', 'Yeah, well...', '...Is that the...', ""...It's such an..."", 'Sorry. Go ahead.', ""...Interesting story to follow. Yeah, no. This is such an interesting story to follow. It sounds like a cyberwar could even be starting. That's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin.

The attack on Tuesday killed at least 70 people, including many children. The U.S. and others suspect Syrian planes dropped chemical weapons. Just this morning, the Russian defense ministry said Syrian aircraft actually struck a rebel stash of chemical weapons on the ground. Yesterday, the White House blamed the latest attack in Syria on the Obama administration's lack of action there."", ""(Reading) These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution."", ""The voice of Sean Spicer, White House spokesman, reading the president's statement on the attack."", ""And Rachel, I want to chat about this with NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman and NPR's Politics editor Domenico Montanaro. Good morning, guys."", 'Good morning.', 'Good morning.', 'Domenico, let me start with you. The White House there, I mean, just clearly blaming the Obama administration for the situation in Syria right now. What is behind this?', ""It's definitely a remarkable statement. And David, let's remember what the Trump White House is referring to is this."", 'We have been very clear to the Assad regime but also to other players on the ground that a redline for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.', ""Well, yeah that's President Obama there. That was the whole redline thing, right?"", ""Well, you know, look - that was the low point really of Obama's foreign policy and undermined so much of his credibility when it came to foreign policy handling. It's amazing though that Trump now as president is, instead of looking forward, he's looking back to what Obama did. And that's likely because he's in quite a box himself. But Tom, you covered so much of this. You know what Obama did and what Trump's options are."", ""Well, first of all, the Trump administration has a point. President Obama was sharply criticized, even by those within his own administration, for not being tougher on Syria early on. Some wanted robust arming of Syrian rebels, taking out President Assad's aircrafts so he couldn't drop bombs or chemical weapons on civilians. Some actually left his administration because he wasn't tough enough."", 'OK. So this whole redline question with President Obama - that brings us to today, this horrific chemical attack. A lot of people pointing the finger at Bashar al-Assad. Does that mean that Donald Trump has some sort of redline? Is it crossed? What does he do now?', ""Well, we don't know. President Trump could take out these Syrian aircraft on his own. He is commander in chief. He has the power to do that now. It's unlikely he will. My guess is he'll do exactly what President Obama did, focus on taking out ISIS and then, over time, work on some type of political settlement in Syria. That's the way ahead."", ""And it's not just guessing. I mean, already Trump administration officials have been shifting the focus to ISIS very explicitly. I mean, here's U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley last week."", ""I think that our goal is to do what we need to defeat ISIS. I don't know that our goal is to talk to Assad in doing that."", ""Taking the focus off of Assad - Domenico, does President Trump have any interest at all in getting rid of Syria's president before or after this chemical attack?"", ""Well, it's clearly not the focus. And we've heard mixed messages coming from the Trump administration. There's been clearly a shift. You heard Nikki Haley talk about him also being a war criminal when it comes to Assad."", ""And really, this comes back to the idea of this Trump administration with this marked policy movement away from the way the Obama administration used to talk with at least tacit support for autocracies. He met with Sisi from Egypt, now not saying that Assad must go - and that's raising a lot of eyebrows in the foreign policy and diplomatic communities."", ""I mean, the bottom line here - there are no good options in Syria. Donald Trump is now learning this the hard way. Easy to criticize when you're on the campaign trail - governing is harder. Working out something like the morass in Syria is much harder when you're in it."", ""It's going to be interesting to look at this U.N. Security Council meeting today - an emergency session has been called. It will be a test of the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, to see how powerful she is in this administration. What she says in this meeting could be interesting. And of course, we have to remember Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, so unlikely to seek consequences for the Bashar al-Assad regime."", ""OK. NPR's Tom Bowman, I know you'll be covering all this. Thanks for coming in this morning."", ""You're welcome."", ""Domenico, stay with us. I want to turn now to this big visit. China's president is coming, is going to be meeting with President Trump in Florida. And Rachel, there were actually some developments overnight."", ""There were. There were developments overnight. The stakes as you mentioned, David, incredibly high around this visit of President Xi Jinping. Trump took a tough line against China throughout his campaigning. Let's take a listen."", 'They are the greatest currency manipulators ever.', 'Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated.', ""So one thing to talk tough on the campaign trail. Again, being president is a different game. So we are going to see exactly whether that tough talk continues when he's face to face. Also, the news overnight - North Korea launched another missile launch, the fourth attempted missile launch this year. It's likely to be front and center in these talks between Trump and Xi."", ""Yeah, it's amazing how world events can suddenly change the dynamics of an entire meeting. We have Domenico Montanaro from our Politics team here. And I also want to bring in NPR's Rob Schmitz who is based in Shanghai."", 'Hey, Rob.', 'Good morning.', ""So what is the feeling about this launch from North Korea over there? And does it really raise the stakes for this summit that's starting?"", ""Well, I think it certainly raises the stakes. And I'm sure that China would prefer that that wouldn't have happened. But I - you know, I think China's leadership going into this summit - they've spent a lot of time preparing for this. And I think that they're ready for it. China's leadership thus far has handled Trump and a lot of his negative comments about China - one where you just heard in the opening there - with a fair amount of patience and confidence."", 'And I think, you know, the Chinese are going to use this summit as a way to get to know Trump face to face and possibly as a way to figure out, you know, sort of how to handle him going forward.', ""Isn't there a weird dynamic here, though, because Trump's first meetings with foreign leaders have been mixed - I guess that's one word we can use."", '(Laughter).', 'I mean, Germans felt that Chancellor Angela Merkel...', 'Yeah.', '...Left humiliated. I mean, Trump got in a Twitter war with the leader of Mexico. And, I mean, I know that China really tries to choreograph meetings like this. So is there a tension there?', ""There's a little tension. I think that Xi Jinping might be a little nervous about some of the unscripted parts of this upcoming summit. But I think for Xi Jinping, what he wants out of this is he's going to want to appear strong to the home crowd in China."", ""This is an important year for China's president. He's going to preside over a very big power shake-up at the end of the year. And in order to (inaudible) as smoothly, he's going to need to appear strong. And the way to do that, I think, is to try and ensure that there's as little drama at this summit as possible. So I think that the goal (inaudible) President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago is to keep this summit as dull and as boring as possible. He's not going to want any..."", ""You don't normally hear the goal is to keep the summit very boring."", 'Exactly.', ""That's when he wants, yeah."", 'Also tough to do with a President Trump who tends to like the drama.', ""Yeah. And who doesn't like to always deal with other people who come across as strong. Domenico, what do you expect from this dynamic? I mean, Trump is not someone who enjoys dealing with someone who is trying to outdo him in strength."", ""Well, what we do know is there's not going to be any golf, first of all, because..."", 'We do know that.', ""...Xi, in China, is trying this anti-corruption policy and says that, you know, golf has been one of these areas where people - where there's been some graft. And he doesn't want to do that at Mar-a-Lago. He says he doesn't play, so I'm not totally sure what they're going to do there."", ""But we know that North Korea is top of the agenda for this White House. They know China has economic leverage over them. This trade relationship - you know, Trump talked very tough. There were lots of nasty comments we could have put together on the things that Trump said about trade and China and how China's been a currency manipulator."", 'But Trump had to walk back his statements about a one-China policy where he took a phone call from the Taiwanese president. And...', 'Really early on and offended the Chinese.', ""Really early on - Xi was really annoyed by this. Trump walked it back, but what's he gotten out of it?"", ""Yeah. So clearly, lots of important issues at stake in this meeting. But interesting - one former negotiator I talked with, someone who worked in the George W. Bush administration, says this launch by North Korea actually gives President Trump a little bit of cover. He doesn't necessarily have to go after China in those tough terms on trade because they have this very important, salient national security issue to talk about."", ""It's going to be interesting to watch the body language, as you guys mentioned. Is there going to be a handshake? How well is this going to be choreographed? And will President Xi Jinping leave feeling like he is on the right step, on the same page as President Trump? We'll see."", 'OK. Hey, Rob Schmitz in Shanghai, thanks a lot.', 'Thank you.', 'And Domenico Montanaro, thanks for coming in for this morning.', 'It was my pleasure, David.', ""Rachel, I got to ask you. I don't know, but I celebrate my wedding anniversaries with my wife by taking her out to dinner (laughter)."", 'OK. That seems like a safe option.', 'Seems like a safe space. Beyonce does it differently. She and Jay-Z celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary a different way. The queen gave it all to us here.', ""(Singing) I don't have a reason to cry. And I have every reason to smile. And I don't have a reason..."", ""She released a studio version of a song that she wrote for Jay-Z plus a video to go with it. It's full of home footage. And I have to say - pretty romantic."", 'OK. So this is surprising to me because if we will remember ""Lemonade"" - little album she dropped in a surprise kind of way, the same thing - she was kind of giving Jay-Z a little bit of the what\'s what. Let\'s take a listen to this.', ""(Singing) Tell him - boy, bye. Sorry. Tell him - boy, bye. Sorry. Boy, bye. Middle fingers up, I ain't thinking about you."", 'Mm-hm, middle finger.', 'OK.', ""Apparently, everything's fine now."", 'So maybe a different Beyonce, that is what to look out for. And - but maybe a window into a relationship that a lot of us will be paying attention to.', ""Probably. I can't help myself. Keep watching."", ""Yeah, new video from Beyonce.

The theme of the night was supposed to have been foreign policy, but the Wall Street meltdown and continuing negotiations over a federal bailout forced their way onto the agenda.","[""This is Weekend Edition from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. John McCain and Barack Obama met at their first debate last night. They clashed over the financial crisis, taxes, spending, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The theme of the night was to have been foreign policy, but the Wall Street meltdown and continuing negotiations over a federal bailout forced their way onto the agenda. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports from the campus of the University of Mississippi in Oxford where the debate took place."", ""The first 40 minutes of the debate were devoted to the financial crisis and the economy, the number one issue for voters. Both candidates had flown to Mississippi from Washington after taking part in the talks about a rescue package. Although negotiations continue, the broad elements of a deal are known, so the moderator of the debate, PBS's Jim Lehrer, started off by asking where they stood on the plan. Obama took the opportunity to press his main attack on McCain."", ""We also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections, and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasn't worked."", 'Obama, who has a big advantage over McCain on the economy, wanted to focus on the problem and how Bush and McCain had caused it. McCain wanted to focus on a solution.', ""Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing for the first time in a long time Republicans and Democrats together sitting down trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in."", ""McCain had shaken things up this week by demanding that he and Obama return to Washington to be part of the congressional talks with the White House. McCain is trying to wring some dividend from the economic crisis that has been hurting him and his party in the polls. So last night he focused on what he called his leadership in the midst of crisis, especially his efforts to get the House Republicans to endorse the president's bailout plan."", ""And yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives, and they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem."", ""But Obama wasn't about to let McCain forget what he recently said about the economy."", 'Ten days ago John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. I do not think that they are.', 'Say it directly to him.', 'I will do that. John, 10 days ago you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound, and...', ""Were you afraid I couldn't hear him?"", ""I am just determined to get you all to talk to each other. I'm going to try."", ""The moderator tried without much success to get the two men to engage each other directly, but each preferred to address the television audience. Still, there was plenty of sparring on taxes and spending. McCain called Obama the most liberal member of the Senate. He said it's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. Obama tied McCain to Bush."", ""John, it's been your president, who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time, who presided over this increase in spending, this orgy of spending, and enormous deficits. And you voted for almost all of his budgets."", 'On this, as on other issues, McCain was at pains to distance himself from Bush.', ""It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate, nor with the administration. I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoners, on Guantanamo Bay, on a long - on the way that the Iraq war was conducted. I have a long record, and the American people know me very well."", 'Obama got McCain on the defensive by hammering on his ties to President Bush.

On Iraq, McCain said the most important task of the next president is to decide how and when to leave Iraq, and what to leave behind.', ""Senator Obama said the surge could not work. He said it would increase sectarian violence. He said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program he said it exceeded our wildest expectations. But yet after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today. Incredibly, Senator Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus."", 'Obama pressed what he called the fundamental difference between them on Iraq, the decision to invade in the first place.', 'John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003. And at that time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong. You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni, and you were wrong.', 'Slightly ahead in the polls, Obama wanted to hold his own and look presidential last night to come across as a credible commander in chief. McCain came hoping to press his advantage on foreign policy. And in discussing Iraq, Iran, Russia, and Afghanistan he pointed repeatedly to his long record and experience and travel to those regions. Finally, he summed up his brief against his younger opponent.', ""I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience, and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian aggression in Georgia, to his - you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded. And failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is - shows to me that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that."", ""I don't need on-the-job training, McCain said. I am ready to go at it right now. Obama ended by promising he would restore America's standing in the world."", ""What the next president has to do, and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe, is to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams."", ""Neither man has a reputation as a terrific debater, but last night they were both at what may have been their best. Both were relaxed and forceful. McCain stayed focused and didn't get angry. Obama was crisper and less professorial than in his primary debates. Neither committed any gaffes, nor did either land a knockout blow. And the entourage for both declared their man the clear winner.

Where did our love for ice cream come from? Journalist Amy Ettinger says it dates back to our Founding Fathers.,"[""For a long time now, we've been talking about partisan divisions between Republicans and Democrats. They're at odds over everything from how to fix health care to how to fight terrorism. But there is one thing they can agree on."", 'My name is Joe Biden, and I love ice cream.', ""Chocolate is good for your teeth. It's my cup of coffee."", ""Wherever I get ice cream, I'm all in favor."", ""I'm going to go for the classic mint chocolate chip."", 'Of course, that was former Vice President Joe Biden, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former President Barack Obama. So on this Fourth of July weekend, we wanted to take a few minutes to look back on how ice cream became one of America\'s most popular treats, to the tune of some 45 pints per person per year on average. Journalist Amy Ettinger told us all about it in a piece in The Washington Post last week titled ""How Ice Cream Went From Elitist Indulgence To America\'s Favorite Frozen Treat."" It turns out that the Founding Fathers had a lot to do with that. Amy Ettinger is with us now from San Francisco to tell us more. Hi, Amy, welcome. Happy Fourth.', 'Hi. Thank you.', ""So you were telling us in your piece that George Washington is one of the people who sparked the country's fondness for ice cream. Tell us about it."", ""So he had an absolute sweet tooth, as we all know. It turns out his real love was for ice cream. He was introduced to it around 1768 or 1770, and then he became an addict. He started serving it at Mount Vernon all the way back in 1784. And when they did a catalog of his possessions, he had a 306-piece ice cream serving set. So it was just such a large part of Martha and George's life."", 'So which of our other presidents were fans of ice cream?', ""So Thomas Jefferson, when he was in France, he became quite the foodie. And he actually recorded America's first ice cream recipe, which was an 18-step process that included hand churning the ice cream for 10 minutes. So it was quite a labor, but he really spared no expense to be able to get this treat. He had ice houses built at his estate at Monticello, and he was able to serve it year-round because of that."", 'Well, in fact, that is part of the tour at Monticello is, you know, you get to see the icehouses. And so you get a sense of just how much he really liked that. But that suggests that you really had to have some resources in order to enjoy ice cream at one point. So how did it go from something that only a select few could enjoy to something that is everywhere?', 'The ice trade really took off in the, you know, late-18th, early-19th century. And this enabled folks to be able to more easily have access to ice. And that was, of course, key in being able to make ice cream.', 'And you were also telling us that the passion for ice cream reached a new intensity during prohibition. How did that work?', ""So people needed an alternative vice (laughter). They couldn't have their booze, and the Temperance Movement actually was pushing ice cream parlors as an alternative to the saloon. So in 1920, our nation's first year without alcohol, consumers ate 260 millions gallons of ice cream."", 'Before we let you go, what made you want to do so much research into this and even write a book about it?', ""I have always loved ice cream. And I remember eating it all the time as a kid. And when I started doing the research, I saw, well, it doesn't just go back to my own personal childhood, it goes back to the birth of the country. And I wanted to research that, be able to bring that history and make it come alive with my own memories of having it as a kid and talking to all the folks around the country who are making it and serving it every day."", 'That\'s Amy Ettinger.

George W. Bush spoke of a global war on terror.', 'Our war on terror begins with al-Qaida, but it does not end there.', 'Barack Obama tried to avoid the phrase global war on terror.', 'We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.', 'And then this week, Donald Trump used a new phrase to describe the people behind the attack in Manchester.', 'By evil losers in life.', 'Joining us now to discuss how presidents have described the terrorist threat and what kind of impact that language has is Farah Pandith of the Council on Foreign Relations. She has worked for presidents of both parties countering extremism. Welcome to the program.', ""Thank you so much. It's good to be here."", ""When you hear him use the phrase losers, does that sound to you like a departure from the kind of language we've heard from other presidents?"", ""It's not as precise as other presidents have used. It's very authentic to this president. It's the kind of terminology he uses. And so that's important for us to remember because when this president is speaking, he's not just speaking, obviously, to an American public. He's speaking to the world. And he's speaking to those people who are listening very carefully to the way in which he sounds and what he says, what's the substance in what he's saying."", ""Loser seems to be a phrase that has a diminishing quality on the people it's applied to as opposed to warriors or murderers. President Trump has criticized his predecessor, President Obama, for not being strong and tough enough on the issue of terrorism. Do you think that calling these people losers fits in with the positions that Trump has taken in the past?"", ""President Trump as a candidate used that word before in other contexts. President Trump as commander in chief has talked about the issue of ISIS as a terrorist group. But he has also connected it to the religion of Islam. And what you saw in his trip to the Middle East is a departure from the connectivity between the religion of Islam and the terrorist organization. And I think that's an important thing to understand. The issue here is for extremists who are listening, too. They're not - they're also part of the audience that the president is speaking to."", ""They use our words against us to prove their theory that the West is at war with Islam. So when a president uses terminology - in this case, evil loser - we cannot disagree with the idea that the group is evil and that loser is the opposite of a hero. It's somebody who is failing. And that is what the - the impression that he's trying to get across."", 'You have worked with Muslim communities around the world, people who are moderate and not extremists. Do they listen very closely to the language that an American president uses to describe terrorism?', ""I don't think the American public really understands how carefully audiences around the world listen to words. And the way things are translated matters, too, which is why when you're using fuzzier language, things that have nuances, it is much harder in different languages to get precise about what it is we're saying. So it is easier for the bad guys to be able to manipulate our words and the context, which is why you have seen an evolution in the way in which we understand what's happening in terms of people absorbing things."", 'What do you make of the fact that 16 years after 9/11 there is still no consensus on the language to use when describing this problem?', ""The problem of an ideology that has inspired groups like al-Qaida or Shabaab or the Taliban or ISIS and everything in between, it's very complicated. And I think in this 21st century we want a soundbite that's going to make it all easy. So you're spending all of this time talking about the perfect phrase that's going to work to describe all of these types of groups. And the fact is, 16 years after 9/11, we are not going to get consensus on what the perfect phrase is because there are many different audiences."", 'I think what a president must do is to keep the drumbeat strong that in fact this ideology that is being used by these terrorist organizations are not connected to the religion of Islam.

Hi, David.', 'Good to be with you.', ""So, E.J., when you look at the cabinet appointments that Donald Trump has made so far, what do you think they tell us about the kind of president he's likely to be?"", ""I am reminded of one of Ronald Reagan's great line that he once said the problem with my administration is that the right hand doesn't know what the far-right hand is doing. And here what you have are normal right-wing Republicans, people like Reince Priebus, close to the Koch brothers, a very ideological conservative but a normal politician, Betsy DeVos, a big advocate of vouchers and charter schools at the Education Department. And then you've got Jeff Sessions, Steve Bannon, General Flynn - I mean, so far there's very little reassurance for anybody who is not on the right, some reassurance for conventional conservatives. And I think that the fight over Mitt Romney, which we'll get to, suggests how much difficulty there'll be in other kinds of voices penetrating this cabinet."", 'David, I wonder if you really see this as right versus far-right, or is there also some sort of alt-right influence? I mean, Steve Bannon cannot exactly be considered mainstream Republican or ultra conservative per se.', ""Yeah, I'd say pop-right. There's a bunch of head banger, Guns 'N Roses conservatives types."", 'I was being respectful when I said far-right, you know?', ""I meant that as a compliment. You know, I regard so far the picks as amazingly coherent with the campaign. This is a populist nationalist candidate, and he's picked by and large populist nationalist people. And I think Steve Bannon put it well. They're going to try to spend a lot of money, make some conservatives very upset with how much federal spending there is in a way to give working-class people jobs and probably a way to get working-class people of different races over to their side. I think that's the vision, to create a multi-racial populist majority. And so far I have to say these are not conventional Republicans. It's populist Trumpian nationalists."", ""I want to dissent from that in one respect. The New York Times had a headline on its website - Trump Turning To Ultra Wealthy To Steer Economic Policy. This doesn't sound very populist to me. Today's commerce secretary, the names being talked about for treasury secretary, I think there will be populist talk but maybe no populist action."", ""Just quick one quick point on that. Populists love rich people. They just hate professionals. So they hate journalists, they hate teachers, they hate lawyers, but they tend to like rich people. There's something deeply consistent."", ""Let's talk..."", '...Some kinds of populists.', ""Let's talk specifically about the position of secretary of state because the reported divide in Trump's inner circle between Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, two of the apparent candidates for secretary of state, seems to reflect a larger divide within the Republican Party, David."", ""Yeah. If - I mean, of course, I don't want him to pick Mitt Romney because he's a professional, he's calm, he's competent and he does believe in expansive foreign policy. If I were Donald Trump, I would definitely not pick Mitt Romney because it's very easy for Mitt Romney to have have a separate foreign policy operatus in the State Department that would run a dissenting foreign policy from the White House foreign policy. There, I think the populist America-first foreign policy of Donald Trump does run against a potential rival. Of course, I hope he picks that rival because I think Romney's foreign policy is sensible. But that would be the first big break from his campaign if he picked Romney."", 'And this shows a bit of how bizarre the internal process seems to be. I cannot remember another administration where a major figure in the orbit, Kellyanne Conway in this case, the campaign manager, tweeted out that the Trump base was uneasy with Romney. There was pushback against Romney on Twitter in public. Either she was sending a signal for Trump or she is lobbying from Twitter, something she knows that Trump actually reads. Very, very strange.', ""She said something to my co-host Audie Cornish earlier this week that stuck in my head, which was any time you try to apply conventional techniques to Donald Trump, you're going to be disappointed. We've been talking about the possibility that he'll be populist, far-right, center-right. What about the possibility that he will just sort of abolish political norms? I mean, he hasn't had a press conference since July. He hasn't released his tax returns. He seems uninterested in avoiding conflicts of interests with his international business ties. How dramatically are the norms of American politics shifting here, David?"", ""Well, if the cabinet members are live-tweeting the cabinet sessions, then we know we've got a new world. So far, I have to say he's been a little less raucous than in the campaign. In - since he's in the transition process, there's been nothing outrageously offensive. And the campaign - the transition process has been going more or less normally. And so we'll see how much of that was showmanship in the campaign if whether he settles down from here on out."", 'E.J.', 'I guess we\'re watching a bit of a different transition process. I\'m struck, for example, by his tweet attacking the cast of ""Hamilton,"" his attacks on The New York Times. I think there are two sets of issues here.

Will there be use of government agencies, as he's sort of threatened in the campaign, against his political enemies?

One is that a lot of political advertising is moving online. Another is that the Trump campaign doesn't appear to have produced a single Spanish ad, though last week a pro-Trump super PAC did start airing one in Nevada. But Anthony Williams, who helped develop Spanish ads for Obama's re-election campaign, says the main reason is Donald Trump's record-low support among Latinos."", ""He's already been on TV for, you know, 50, 100, $200 million worth of airtime saying horrible things about Hispanics.

We explore the topic further.","[""Black Lives Matter protesters sent a message yesterday in several places in the United States. They are fed up with what they see as widespread police abuse. One protest at the nation's largest shopping mall just outside Minneapolis resulted in several arrests. This has been a year when race and racism have been at the center of our national dialogue. And when my colleague Steve Inskeep spoke to President Obama for a year-end interview at the White House, the president said he has seen some signs that the country has become more tolerant."", ""When I talk to my daughters and their friends, I think they are more tolerant, more welcoming of people who are different than them, more sophisticated about different cultures and what's happening around the world."", ""That was President Obama speaking to my colleague Steve Inskeep in a year-end interview at the White House. And I was listening back to that with Gene Demby from NPR's Code Switch team. He covers race, ethnicity and culture. Gene, thanks for coming in."", 'Thanks for having me, David.', 'Gene, just listening to the president there, I wonder how you react to that. I mean, in 2015, are we a more tolerant country?', 'It sort of depends on what you mean by tolerant.', 'OK.', ""There's this optimistic view. There's this thing we tend to tell ourselves about younger people, that they'll come in, and they'll replace the views of older people, which may be sort of outdated or outmoded. But a theme we keep coming back to on Code Switch this year was just how much younger people share a lot of the views on race and big racial issues that older generations did."", 'They have some of the same stereotypes, biases all of that?', ""Same stereotypes and biases, same opinions on things like affirmative action and sort of racial policies. I think one of the reasons we've seen in a lot of polls that younger people have similar views to their parents is that younger people don't actually live in a materially different world than their parents did. It's hard to sort of overstate how much Americans live separately from each other. We don't go to the same schools. We don't live in the same neighborhoods. And so we don't have really good understandings of each other's experiences."", ""I'm thinking of Baltimore when you say that. There's this news this week that the NAACP is demanding that Baltimore build a rail line that goes from the East to the West, which is - the governor has now said he's not going to do. And the argument is that there has to be access to predominantly, you know, lower and middle-class African American neighborhoods to help people move to get to other neighborhoods to sort of have a more integrated society, it sounds like. So those institutional barriers are still in place."", 'Still in place everywhere. And you will also see the distance between Americans in the way we respond to incidents like, speaking of Baltimore, the Freddie Gray incident, in which...', 'The young man who died in police custody, yeah.', ""That's right. That's a really polarizing case. Depending on where you live and depending on who you are and - you know, you're much more likely to see this set of events very differently. But you do see - Pew released a poll late this summer that found that a growing number of Americans across racial and ethnic groups do say that the country needs to make - continue making changes to achieve racial equality. A third of respondents said that racism was a big problem in America just five years ago. But 50 percent of the respondents this year in the Pew poll said that America needed to continue to make changes to achieve racial equality. So more people are thinking about the way race informs and constrains American life. And that could be a result of the way we've been paying attention to this drumbeat of stories about race and racial tensions."", 'The reality is it sounds like this might have been a year when a lot of Americans have just confronted that our society remains very segregated. And there are a lot of things to be sort of worked out and talked about.', ""I think that's exactly right. I mean, all the unrest and protests that we've seen on college campuses this year in a lot of ways could be a sign of progress, right? Our college campuses are increasingly diverse. And for a whole lot of Americans who go to college, their college campuses will be the only multiracial social space that they'll live in. And so the tension and the messiness there of people trying to work out what that means to live in a shared space, right, is what we're seeing on these college campuses. And it - you know, it looks messy. But given our history, how could it really be any other way?"", ""As you have followed the conversations this year - and let's say people involved in the Black Lives Matter movement, people who have been furious over the treatment of African-Americans by police in some of these incidents - are they, in the end, still arriving at this place, that 2015 might have been a year of progress because at least the conversation's happening?"", ""There are so many conversations that are materially different because Black Lives Matter has been part of them. I mean, it's easy to forget that they didn't even exist a year and a half ago. It's sort of hard to overstate how much they've moved the conversation and how much they've changed the way we talk about so many of these issues. They've put it on the radar. But they've also kept it on the radar, which is really important."", ""And you broaden that out - I mean, I think about same-sex marriage being such a big topic with the Supreme Court case. I think about Donald Trump and making comments about Muslims that have sparked quite a reaction and quite a conversation. You know, you mentioned the Black Lives Matter movement being part of the conversation. I mean, if you look at 2015 and all of that that's happened, sort of how do you reflect on it?"", ""I mean, the story we want to tell ourselves is always one of sort of just unbroken progress that America has this, like, long trajectory towards, you know, a more perfect union. And it's easy to tell ourselves that we're there, right? I mean, you see multiracial families on TV. You see all kinds of brown people in commercials for things.

It's hard to make any predictions at this point. But Trump has made it pretty clear that he does plan to go after Hillary Clinton and her husband's own history of sexual abuse allegations. So while we did hear Trump apologize over the weekend for his words that were revealed in that recording, he quickly turned the conversation to Bill Clinton. And if you look at his Twitter feed the last day or so, he's been pretty aggressive promising to stay in the race, signaling he's ready for a fight tonight. And Trump isn't just going to talk about Bill Clinton, but also we expect to talk about how Hillary Clinton handled those situations."", 'And, Tam, how has Hillary Clinton prepared to deal with all of this?', ""Well, Hillary Clinton has, of course, been preparing because that is what Hillary Clinton does. She got to St. Louis today to do some extra preparations.

And she sees this as a time to try to convince them that they could maybe vote for her."", 'We can also expect her to get questions about excerpts of her Wall Street speeches that were posted on WikiLeaks in the last few days.

I mean - I mean, you know, Trump has a needle to thread there because the Republican, you know, strategists and pollsters I talked to have warned Trump against talking too much about Bill Clinton's past. They say that that line of attack is really unpopular with female voters, including many Republican female voters. And he shouldn't look like he's blaming Hillary Clinton for the actions of her husband."", ""Well, Sarah, stay with us for just a second on that - on that point. I mean, the past 48 hours have seen some pretty remarkable turns of events for the Trump campaign. You've seen people jumping ship. I mean, previous people - people who have endorsed him previously withdrawing their endorsement. Talk about the last 48 hours, and what is the state of his candidacy and his relationship with the Republican Party?"", ""It is a remarkable thing to see this close to a general election happening to a major party nominee. So scores of Republicans have denounced Trump's words, and we're talking about leading Republicans. His own running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, the chairman of the Republican National Committee Reince Priebus have all issued strong statements denouncing Trump's words. Others - and they number in the dozens of leading Republicans - we're talking governors, members of Congress, senators - have called for Trump to actually step aside and let Pence step up as the nominee, again, something unprecedented at this point in the campaign."", ""Trump, though, has made it clear that's not what he's going to do. He is really setting up a showdown with many members of his own party. So this morning, he tweeted what really appeared to be a reference to these Republicans who've called for him to step down, calling them self-righteous hypocrites and suggesting that they're hurting their re-election chances because of his popularity. And, you know, Reince Priebus was actually pulled off a Sunday morning show this morning because the campaign wanted someone from the campaign speaking. That role has been filled by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, big supporter of Trump, top surrogate for Trump, who's been on the road with him a lot. He's stepped in and really kind of struggled to defend him on CNN."", ""I am not justifying it. I believe it's wrong. I know he believes it's wrong. I believe that this is not the man that we're talking about today."", ""And he then launched into an attack of Bill Clinton's past and Hillary Clinton's response to it, as we expect Trump to do tonight. We should also note that Giuliani and Priebus flew to the debate on Trump's plane today. If only we could have heard what that conversation was like."", 'Have you had a chance, Sarah, to talk to other Republicans who are also sticking with Donald Trump?', ""Yeah. It sounds like a lot of them are really watching to see what happens over the next couple of days, especially tonight. North Carolina Senator Richard Burr, who's in a tough race to hold on to his seat, has said he will watch Trump's level of contrition in the coming days. And even Pence, who, you know, is still with the campaign has been relatively quiet, saying he can't defend Trump's words and saying that he prays for him and looks forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tonight at the debate. So tonight will be important for Trump to show that he's sorry for what he said, not just sorry he got caught."", ""Now, one person who has not been quiet is President Obama. He weighed in a little while ago at a campaign event in Chicago. Let's play a little bit of that."", ""You know, one of the most disturbing things about this election is just the unbelievable rhetoric coming at the top of the Republican ticket. I don't need to repeat it. There are children in the room."", 'Tam, what do you make of that?', ""Yeah, so I think that this is part of a broader effort from Democrats to say that - that the video that came out is - maybe it's the tipping point, but they don't want to let Senate Republicans and other candidates run from Donald Trump. They want Donald Trump to own - for them to have to own Donald Trump because they stood by him while he said other things and - that were very controversial and problematic.

There was a VIP section near the stage outside the museum full of celebrities and dignitaries - President Obama, former President George W.

The folks that I talked to enjoyed the ceremony, but many noted that it comes at a kind of strange time for the country, given that this has been such a year full of racial unrest. I talked to one woman named Cynthia Kain.', ""Today felt like it was full of contradictions because all week we're bombarded with how black men are being killed in our country, and yet we're asked to celebrate our culture and our contributions on the Mall. So today felt a little bit strange."", 'So Kain said that she hopes the museum and its opening reminds the country that there is still work to be done to live up to its ideals.', 'You mentioned that there were thousands of people there today. But not a lot of them will actually get in to see the museum - at least not today.', ""That is very true. Most of them won't get in. There's a waitlist that is still months-long. There are some folks that have gotten tickets, but even they won't get in until November or December. The museum is trying to get everyone in at some point, though. They have extra-long hours for the opening."", ""You know, but lots of people that haven't gone inside today have been reading up on the museum. I talked with one woman named Barbara Fazio-McGrory. She came down from New York. She'll get in on Monday, and she's really looking forward to seeing the museum's unique layout. It starts underground and walks visitors up to the top floor kind of through black history."", ""The literal darkness of the ground floor, talking about slavery, pictures of people whipped, people hanging from trees, it just makes me very emotional to know that that's there. But then the uplifting of the Yoruba crown and the uplifting to the fifth floor is about the struggle down there and where we are now - not that it's over, it's never going to be over - but there's hope and light and life."", ""So she told me that the country kind of needs this right now, a bright spot in a year that's been really full of divisive politics in a very nasty election."", ""So now that the museum is officially open, what's next?"", ""There's a music festival this weekend; it's got Public Enemy, The Roots and lots of others. And the museum is still being actively curated. There were over 30,000 artifacts submitted and only about 3,000 on display right now.

And they say that will give Syrians the freedom and right to self-determination they deserve. But others, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, say without Assad, Syria will descend into total chaos, and extremists led by ISIS will take over - the example Putin points to, Libya.

Steve Inskeep talks to Ian Kearns, director of the European Leadership Network.","['During the Cold War, job No. 1 for Western intelligence was figuring out what Moscow was up to. That urgency faded after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But Russia is challenging the West again in Ukraine and now in Syria. Last night on the CBS News program ""60 Minutes,"" correspondent Steve Kroft asked President Obama if he knew that President Vladimir Putin was planning military operations in Syria.', 'Did you know he was going to do all this when you met with him in New York?', 'Yeah, we had seen - yeah, we have pretty good intelligence. We watched.', 'So you knew he was already planning to do it?', 'We knew that he was planning to provide the military assistance that Assad was needing because they were nervous about a potential eminent collapse of the regime.', ""And we're going to spend a few minutes now talking about Western intelligence and what the West may have known or not. Ian Kearns is director of the European Leadership Network in London, which focuses on security issues. Mr. Kearns, welcome to the program."", 'Good morning.', 'So what exactly did the West know about Russia and its plans in Syria?', ""Well, I think it's important when talking about intelligence to make a distinction between very good sources of human intelligence, a spy essentially, and on the other hand, having access to what technology can bring, so satellite images which show you a military buildup. And I think it's very clear that the United States government had the satellite images which demonstrated that Russia was engaged in the military buildup in Syria around the Latakia air base."", ""And, in fact, John Kerry was talking about that openly for quite some time a week or so before the Russian airstrikes in Syria began. So it's highly likely that what President Obama was referring to in that clip was the satellite intelligence, maybe some of the communications intelligence, which the U.S. had, rather than a very good source in the Kremlin."", ""So you're saying that the West - the United States, I mean, has the satellite capabilities, has the technology. But are you suggesting they don't have the spies that they might need to know what Russia's intentions might be?"", ""You could either have a source inside the Kremlin - and everybody who studies Russia today believes the decision-making takes place in a very small, tightly knit group around President Putin - but even if you did, that creates a serious dilemma because that person may be giving you superb intelligence, but you may not be able to use it for fear of exposing the fact that you have somebody so close to decision-making. I think what's more likely in this case, though, we lack at this stage very good human intelligence sources right at the heart of the Kremlin."", 'Why might that be?', ""Well, it's a very difficult thing to penetrate at that level of a government. You also have to keep in mind that President Putin himself is a former intelligence operative. They'll be few tricks in the intelligence trade which President Putin is unaware of. And I'm sure that he factors that expertise - that personal expertise and knowledge into his own counterintelligence efforts."", 'With Russia emerging now as it seems - I mean, such a power in Syria and carrying out these military strikes, should we be concerned that the United States and West do not have, you know, good human intelligence in Moscow?', ""I think we should be concerned that we don't have a very good relationship with President Putin, and we don't seem to understand very well what drives his actions. I think there's also a case for arguing that since the end of the Cold War, many Western countries have just underinvested in their expertise on Russia. President Putin has made it quite clear he wants to provide some kind of strategic challenge to the West. Whether he's able to do that, whether he's got the real power resources to do that long term, I think is an open question. But because that seems to be his aspiration, we do need to develop more expertise in this area."", 'Ian Kearns is director of the European Leadership Network.

He said Iran should seize the chance to normalize relations with the world."", ""Because if they do, there's incredible talent and resources and sophistication inside of Iran, and it would be a very successful regional power that was also abiding by international norms and international rules. And that would be good for everybody."", ""The president says Iran may not change, which is why inspections are designed to limit its nuclear program no matter what.

They win either way.', 'Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel says Iran might secretly try to continue nuclear development now or just do it later after parts of the deal expire. Views of the future color many arguments about this deal. So as part of an NPR News special broadcast, our colleague Steve Inskeep asked experts for their scenarios of the future.', 'Each scenario is different. Each highlights different parts of a complicated equation. And to be clear, each is presented here only as a plausible scenario. A full-blown prediction in the Middle East is worthless. We will call one possibility the Brinksmanship Scenario. It comes from a prominent opponent of the deal. He is Frederick Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute.', ""The Iranian interest is to continue the deal for as long as possible as long as they're not actually being interfered with in ways that they find unpleasant."", ""Kagan expects things to get unpleasant, and here's why. The United States wants to lift economic sanctions tied to Iran's nuclear program. The United States wants to maintain economic sanctions against Iran on other issues, like support for terrorism. In the Brinksmanship Scenario, that doesn't work."", ""We are going to want to sanction them for a variety of malign activities, including killing, you know, our allies and possibly Americans. And every time we do that, the Iranians are going to threaten to walk away from the deal. And so we're going to be engaged in this constant deal brinkmanship over, is it worth it to us to run the risk to impose the sanctions and the Iranians might walk away, and what would it mean if they walk away? And the Iranians have to calculate, is it worth it to us to walk away and so forth? This is going to be the future of trying to manage this deal."", ""If you're the U.S. president and you're in that position, you're trying to go after Iran on non-nuclear issues, Iran responds, this is not fair; we're walking away from the deal - if you're the U.S. president, don't you say, fine, walk away, start enriching uranium again and we'll end up with war and we'll bomb you and we'll win. Why wouldn't the president say that?"", ""Well, hang on. That's what a president should say up to the we'll end up with a war. But it should be, yeah, OK, walk, absolutely and we're going to sanction you and we're going to try to snap back the sanctions and we're going to try to do a whole bunch of other stuff and make it as painful for you as possible"", ""But in Frederick Kagan's view, a future president won't really have that choice. He says President Obama framed the nuclear deal as a way to avoid war. So if a future president threatens the deal..."", ""You will immediately have a chorus of people who are saying, this begins the march to war. It's Iraq all over again. A lot of presidents, potential presidents won't care about that."", 'Well, in this...', 'Some will.', 'Yeah, although in this situation, Iran is walking away from the deal. Iran is being dared to walk away from the deal.', ""And shockingly I'm willing to predict that that's not how it will be played by the defenders of the deal and by the increasing numbers of people who, for economic reasons, will be invested in having the deal continue. And in my view, this deal effectively sacrifices our ability to influence Iran on non-nuclear issues in exchange for whatever you think about the nuclear agreement, and that's a huge mistake. So I want to sanction this IRGC individual who has been in Syria helping the Assad regime gas his own people. I get the word from the Iranians, if you do that, we're going to walk away from the deal. Do I want to fight that fight? I don't know."", ""Kagan argues that Iran is not really that committed to the nuclear deal. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, allowed the negotiations, but has not publicly endorsed the agreement itself."", ""You pointed out that Ayatollah Khamenei's view is, it's stupid to negotiate with the Americans because no matter what you've negotiated, they're going to cheat. It's possible to summarize much of what you've said as the American version of that. No matter what we've negotiated here, the Iranians are going to cheat. I don't mean to suggest, as Obama did, oh, you're just like an Iranian hardliner. I'm not suggesting that. But there is this mutual suspicion here, which I find very interesting. Do you feel that your suspicions are in some way mirrored by the suspicions on the other side?"", ""Yeah, look, I'm not insulted by it at all. I mean, I think President Obama put in an incredibly insulting way, as he has put most of his attacks on reasonable critics. But I think the Iranians are right, and we're talking about this."", ""I think that the United States collectively - not the United States as embodied in Barack Hussein Obama, but the United States collectively has not signed up to this deal and doesn't really necessarily intend as a nation to abide by it. We have a whole lot of candidates saying they don't intend to abide by it."", ""In Frederick Kagan's Brinksmanship Scenario, the deal only adds to mutual suspicion and distrust. Now let's hear another scenario, the Modest Hope Scenario, which comes from Haleh Esfandiari. She's an Iranian-American scholar who was imprisoned in Iran in 2007. Now in Washington, she sees the Iran agreement as a beginning. She focuses on Hassan Rouhani, the president whose administration made the nuclear deal."", 'The ball is in the court of Mr. Rouhani. He has now to deliver his other promises to the people, regardless of what the supreme leader says.', 'Rouhani won election in 2013, promising better relations with the world and also a better life at home.', 'People are expecting an improvement in the economy. People are expecting a lowering in the cost of living. People are expecting more access to the outside world, especially the younger generation are expecting access to employment. They hope that there will be a lot of foreign investment as a result, leading to a lot of jobs.', ""The clerics who oversee the government will face pressure to open up the country despite their reluctance. Esfandiari does not expect the forces of change to topple Iran's government. She does expect smaller change."", 'The conflict is going to be within the elite, definitely.', 'Within the elite...', 'Yes.', '...Meaning that the current elite stays in charge of the country. They just argue among themselves...', 'Oh, yes.', '...Over the precise rules.', 'Yeah.', 'In your scenario, if it plays out, will a more democratic society emerge?', 'It has to.', 'Will a different Iranian foreign policy emerge?', 'It has to. Iran will have to reconsider some of its foreign policy, especially in the region. This does not mean that Iran will give up the support for Hezbollah or its important role in Iraq or in Syria, but it means that it will reach out to the Persian Gulf countries.', ""The Modest Hope Scenario from Haleh Esfandiari at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars. And then there's the scenario of a longtime visitor to Iran. The journalist Robin Wright has reported on the country for decades."", ""The nuclear deal, at the end of the day, is not just about nukes. It's about the future of Iran politically. It's about the future of the revolution."", ""The Islamic Revolution of 1979. That was the year Iranians took American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. It's been closed ever sense."", 'I went back to the U.S. Embassy in Iran in May and got a tour of a building that is today a museum, where everything looks exactly as it was when it was captured. The tape for the telex machine and the intercepts machine are in place. The passport equipment, the stamps and so forth are in place. It looks like the whole staff just got up and went out for a coffee break. I was given a tour by a docent who was with one of the branches of the revolutionary guards. And I asked him the question, do you foresee the reopening of this embassy anytime soon? And he said, no.', ""Not in this building, but the man did expect an American presence will return in some form to Tehran. And that leads Robin Wright to what we could call the Cautious Opening Scenario. Wright suspects the nuclear dear may initially cause Iran's ruling clerics to try to clamp down on society and prevent too much change."", 'But the truth is that what\'s been unleashed here is a different kind of process. It\'s the beginning of a healing process. It\'s that phase that Crane Brinton writes about in ""The Anatomy Of Revolution"" about the beginning of normalcy, the end of a raging fever. But that doesn\'t mean it\'s going to happen soon and that it\'s not going to be fitful. The revolutionary philosophy hasn\'t changed. But there is an opening, and it is just that. It is one opening when there need to be a lot more to make a difference.', 'Two nations - the United States and Iran - share a long and bitter history.

Usher says that the media is reporting crime more, and in new ways. The more people consume bad news in the world, she explains, the more they believe it is more dangerous than it really is.","[""One theme of the Republican convention last week was the alarming level of crime. That theme was central to Donald Trump's acceptance speech."", 'Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.', 'That prompted this rebuttal from President Obama.', 'The violent crime rate in America has been lower during my presidency than any time in the last three, four decades.', ""So why does the public perception of crime exceed the reality of the threat? Well, you could say it's a case of terrorism actually succeeding, making people feel vulnerable to random attack. And there have been increases in homicides in several cities, including Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. But is there also a fear of crime driven by what we and others in the news media report on? Well, Nikki Usher has been examining that question. She's an assistant professor at George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs. Welcome to the program."", 'Thank you.', 'Are the news media over-reporting violent crime in America?', ""So what we know is that the news media has always over-reported violent crime. This has been something that's been pervasive even since the '70s. You know, if it bleeds it leads, particularly in local television news. But what's happened now have been some pretty significant changes to the news media itself. And part of that is driven by the acceleration of the 24/7 news environment. So you have all news media competing for the same attention span at the same time. This creates a new reality for news production."", 'You have studied newsrooms around the country, including ours...', 'Yes.', '...To see how they go about making these decisions. In a nutshell, what have you learned about newsrooms and deciding to go with violent crime stories?', ""So today in most modern metropolitan newsrooms, there's a breaking news team that is explicitly devoted to up-to-the-minute updates of web content. And so these people are sitting there sort of like the cops reporter has traditionally with the scanner. But their driving motive is to get the latest news online as much as possible. You know you can get a reliable amount of web traffic if you post a crime story. Now, of course, this is sort of circular, right? If you keep posting crime stories and that keeps getting a reaction from people, you'll post more crime stories."", ""Do you think that part of what's happening is that fears of terrorism and arguments over the use of guns take a given story - some guy shoots three people someplace in the country - and immediately attaches big questions of national policy?"", ""So I think the most interesting thing about the compounding effect of terrorism is that it plays into yet another fear that people have. And one of the things we know is that news organizations help people form their understanding about the world. So with increased coverage of terrorism, more people are thinking about terrorism as part of their daily world experience. This is compounded in another way, though, because now you have an entire conversation of people taking place online through Twitter, through comments on news stories. And so there's almost a compounding effect as people remind each other why there's a reason to be scared."", ""But I'm trying to think - I mean, I suppose if I read that in a particular area where there are known to be lots of gangs - I'm very concerned for the people who might be caught up in that somehow, but I'm not personally concerned about that. If I hear that somebody who has declared allegiance to ISIS has just walked into a random building and started shooting, I can feel some possible vulnerability to that attack. Those two events are different in the way that I would perceive them."", ""So there's actually an effect called the mean world syndrome. People who spend a lot of time with media content tend to think the world is a more violent place regardless of where that violence actually takes place. I think there's also..."", ""...You're not just talking about news reports on television. You're talking about..."", 'People.', '...Also fiction on television.', ""Yeah. I mean, people - the line that was used when these studies of cultivation by Gerbner and Gross first came about was that people from the crib to the grave grow up with television. And now they also grew up with the internet amplifying what - and also adding to what's shown on television. So from the cradle to the grave, you're getting all of these images about violence around you. And that's how you orient yourself to the world."", 'Professor Nikki Usher of George Washington University.

Dionne of the Washington Post and Brookings Institution and David Brooks of The New York Times, about the terror attack in Nice, France, and Donald Trump's new running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.","[""And now to last night's attack in Nice, France. Just a few hours after a truck drove through the crowd, killing more than 80 people, both U.S. presidential candidates called into cable news channels to offer their views. And though Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton disagree on many things, last night on Fox, they agreed about this."", ""This is war. If you look at it, this is war coming from all different parts. And frankly, it's war. And we're dealing without - with people without uniforms."", ""This is a war against these terrorist groups, the radical jihadist groups. It's a different kind of war. We need to be smart about how we wage it, but we have to be determined that we're going to win it."", 'And this afternoon at the White House, President Obama had this to say.', 'We will win this fight by staying true to our values - values of pluralism and rule of law and diversity - and freedoms, like the freedom of religion, freedom of speech and assembly.', 'Our regular Friday political commentators are with us - E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and The Brookings Institution. Hi, E.J.', 'How are you?', 'And David Brooks of The New York Times is also here. Hey, David.', 'How are you?', ""I'm good. David, do you see this drumbeat of terror attacks shaping the national mood in politics?"", ""Very much so. First, it's the steady - steady drumbeat of violence, both domestic and foreign. First of all, it raises an atmosphere of fear. I think it increases an atmosphere of pessimism. But more specifically, it increases an atmosphere of suspicion of globalization."", ""This - this election is largely fought over - between a nationalist candidate, who's Donald Trump, and a more globalist one, who's Hillary Clinton and who believes more in the free movement of people and goods. And Trump's more closed nationalism is - historically, when these things happen, that sort of nationalism is more appealing to people. And so I think Trump's candidacy and his viability right now is fueled by what's really a horrible, global atmosphere of fear."", ""So you're saying this ripples out not just to national security, but immigration, trade and other issues. E.J., what do you think the reactions of these two candidates tells us about the kind of campaign we're looking at here?"", ""Well I think that Trump is determined to sound tough and threatening. And Hillary Clinton is determined to sound determined and calm. It's very interesting. She put up an ad recently where the tagline is, a steady leader in an unsteady world. She's making a bet that enough voters - even though I agree with David that there is this atmosphere of fear and worry, she's betting that enough voters think somebody who's safe, who has experience - and she's certainly pushing that - is somebody you can trust more."", ""But clearly there is a constituency for someone like Trump, who - and Trump thinks they'll turn to a strong man willing to break the rules if that's what it takes. But those clips you played at the beginning of the show were perfect because they showed Hillary Clinton is not going to let Trump get to her tough side, if she can help it."", ""Yeah, you know, there's this kind of crass line in Washington that terrorist attacks help Republicans. But, David, we've seen enough terrorist attacks in the last six months to have some evidence. Is that really true?"", ""Well, historically, it's been true. This is a year - weird year and a weird sort of Republican Party now led by Donald Trump. I do think - my general rule of politics and general presidential elections is the candidate - voters go for the person who promises the most order. And so, for - in 2008, John McCain was suspending his campaign. He seemed disorderly. Barack Obama seemed calm and smooth. He seemed orderly. 2004 - George W. Bush seemed order - the force of order against terror, and John Kerry less so."", ""In this campaign, as E.J. elucidated, we have two different sorts of order. We have the muscular machismo of Trump versus the more steady, experienced, calm and predictability of Clinton. And those are two promises of different kinds of orderliness. People have enough risks in their life. When they vote for a president, I think they want someone who's - where the downside is relatively limited."", 'Well, we had expected a big announcement from the Trump campaign today about who his vice president would be. It ended up leaking yesterday that it was Mike Pence. He postponed the announcement. The ceremony will be tomorrow. He announced it on Twitter today. So after all of that, E.J., what does the knowledge that Trump has chosen Pence - the Indiana governor - bring to our understanding of his ticket?', ""Well, I think Donald Trump did just as everybody said he's done. He picked a safe choice. He picked a traditional choice. Pence won't hurt him too much, except among social liberals, who are already on the attack. He may help him with Republican politicians and some conservatives. But I also think the choice of Pence is a sign of real weakness because there were many Republicans who could have helped Trump far more - I think, just for a couple, John Kasich and Rob Portman of Ohio."", ""But so many Republicans said that they didn't want to run with Trump that he was reduced, in the end, to Pence, the safe, very conservative guy. Chris Christie or Newt Gingrich - and Newt - never let it be said that Newt is bereft of self-awareness. He made this wonderful statement where he said he and Trump would constitute a two-pirate ticket. They were both pirates, whereas Pence was a relatively stable, more normal person. And that's who he picked."", ""David, CNN and NBC are each reporting that, as late as midnight last night, Trump was making calls asking if he could get out of the Pence choice - not something that we've independently confirmed, but what do you make of this?"", ""Well, you know, he's - he's shambolic. And, you know, even after announcing the choice, they didn't update the website. They didn't have talking points to the press. They didn't have all the normal things that a campaign does because this is not a normal campaign. I'm tremendously interested to see if we see this shambolic disorganization flow into the convention next week. That'll be, to me, one of the big stories of the convention."", 'Well, they already had a couple people who were listed on the speakers roster pull out.', ""Right, I'm..."", 'Tim Tebow, for one.', '...Mourning the loss of Tim Tebow, but we do have Lynyrd Skynyrd, so I\'m looking forward to a good ""Free Bird.""', 'In our last minute...', '""Sweet Home Alabama.""', ""That'll be the one state he carries, by the way."", ""I do want to ask you about the Democratic side of the campaign, where Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton. E.J., do you think this brings the unity to the Democratic Party that they're going to need?"", ""Yeah, I mean, I think it's really striking that, after all the talk about democratic disunity, you had Sanders issue a really strong statement in supporting Hillary. Of course, he talked about the achievements of his campaign. He's gotten some concessions on the platform and in Hillary's positions. But it was a very strong endorsement, and you also had that very powerful speech from President Obama."", ""So I think that the talk of Democrats being divided that we heard so much of just turned out to be talk and nothing more. I think the issue will be, to some of Sanders' most ardent supporters who have their doubts about Clinton - it's not so much that they're going to vote for Donald Trump - it's will they vote. Particularly, will young people vote? And so I think Sanders and President Obama are going to have a very important role in this campaign, partly as mobilizers and as organizers."", ""We're going to have to leave it there. E.J.

By seeing it, by people feeling a sense of urgency about it, by the larger American community realizing that, gosh, maybe this is a problem - and we've seen even some very conservative commentators begin to acknowledge this is something maybe we need to work on. That promises the possibility of actually getting it done."", 'Kimbriell Kelly is part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team at The Washington Post that has been reporting on fatal police shootings over the last two years. I asked her what the team has discovered.', 'The Post started collecting its own information after Ferguson. And we found out and heard that there were not accurate statistics about police officer-involved shootings. And when we looked at those numbers for the first year, which was in 2015, we found that there was a disparity in the counting at the federal level. We had nearly twice as many officer-involved shootings as anyone else. And so, really, we have continued that count now in the second year to try to get a more accurate portrayal of officer-involved fatal shootings.', ""Tell me what you're finding. What does the data show?"", ""The data shows, in 2015, that there were nearly 1,000 officer-involved fatal shootings. And so we had about 990. If you compare that to today, there's a slight uptick. And we just took a six-month look. So as of the last six months, we had 491 officer-involved fatal shootings. So you do see an increase in civilians who are shot and killed by officers who are on-duty."", 'What are some of the trends that we see? For example, many - race is obviously often an element here. Are black people more likely to be shot by the police than white people are?', 'The answer is yes. If you look at the rate, blacks were 2.5 times more likely to be killed by officers than whites. And in 2016, half of the victims were white and half were minorities.', ""We've also seen, though, a number of cases of law enforcement officers being killed this year - two that have also gotten a lot of attention. Is that part of your reporting as well? Are there any trends there that you can tell us about?"", 'There are definitely trends there. We focus most of our reporting on civilians, but if you do take a look at the statistics, they are very telling. Largely, over time, year to year, you have seen a decrease in the number of officers who have been killed in the line of duty, particularly as it relates to firearms.', ""But there is an uptick that has occurred in the last couple of years. And if you look at the data that's by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, as of July this year, there were 26 firearm-related officer deaths. And that's a 44 percent increase from the 18 deaths that occurred last year."", 'Why is it that a news organization like The Washington Post seems to have more complete record keeping than the government does? Do you know why?', ""It's not very clear why there is a disparity. But the government has acknowledged that one does exist and that they're in the process of making changes to get more accurate and thorough reporting of those numbers."", 'Before we let you go - and, Kimbriell, thanks so much for speaking with us at a very busy time - you will hear people in many communities say this has been an issue for a while and nobody cared. Do you have a theory about why this has now become an issue of national concern?', ""From what I hear, and what I think we're seeing on social media, you know, our telephones play a large role in this with the video. A lot of people are recording this. So cases that people may not have known about that were happening in Dallas, or Baton Rouge, or in St. Paul, Minn., you can now log on to Facebook and see these incidents unfold. And I think that is a new trend that you see."", ""In 2015, we found that there were 70 shootings that were actually captured on officer body cameras. Just in the first six months of 2016, we have found that there have been 63 shootings that have been captured on officer body cameras. And so we're almost at the same numbers from last year. And when you actually look at the whole universe of cameras in general, both body-worn and cell phone cameras by civilians, there's a 38 percent increase in 2016 of fatal officer-involved shootings that have been captured by both civilians and police on cameras."", ""So you think it's the fact that people can see this unfold?"", ""I think that that's definitely one component of it. People are definitely more aware."", 'Kimbriell Kelly is part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team at The Washington Post that has been reporting on fatal police shootings since 2015.

But it's not a permanent solution.","['This week, Washington turned its attention to a part of the U.S. that often gets overlooked - the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. For more than a year, the U.S. territory has been caught in a fiscal crisis, unable to make payments on its $70 billion plus debt and at the same time continuing to pay for basic services like police, education and health care.', ""This week, President Obama signed a law that will put a federal-appointed oversight board in charge of Puerto Rico's finances."", ""People in Puerto Rico need to know that they're not forgotten, that they're part of the American family, and Congress's responsiveness to this issue, even though this is not a perfect bill, at least moves us in the right direction."", ""Joining me now to talk about what this means for Puerto Rico is NPR's Greg Allen. Greg, the law creates a fiscal oversight board appointed by Congress and the White House. It's not made up of elected officials from Puerto Rico who are now in charge of the island's finances. How's that being received on the island of Puerto Rico?"", ""Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag. You have the governor, who's been pushing for this law. The non-voting representative in Congress, our other elected official, has been pushing for this law. They say it's far from perfect. They'd like to see something different, but given the circumstances, it's the best that they could get through Congress."", ""The business community in Puerto Rico has been positive. But you set those on one side, and on the other side you have just about everybody else. Other political leaders on the island, the leaders in the legislature there, are very negative on this. They see this as a violation of what they believe to be the island's sovereignty. We heard Senator Bernie Sanders, one of the critics of this law, call it colonialism. And that's how many people see it there - the federal government stepping in and basically exerting its authority on the island."", ""What will the oversight board be able to do? Can it do what Puerto Rican borrowing authorities haven't been able to do - reschedule debt, make people take haircuts on the bonds?"", ""Well, that is the idea. What's happened is that Puerto Rico, because of its unusual status as a territory, it is not covered by chapter nine bankruptcy law the way that other public institutions within the states are. So for that reason, Puerto Rico has been trying to get that chapter nine bankruptcy authority through Congress hasn't worked. So they've decided to support this instead."", 'Now, this is not being called a control board. This is being called an oversight board, as a kind of a nod to trying to get away from the charges of colonialism. But this board will be able to enter into voluntary discussions with creditors. But ultimately, it does have the authority to restructure some of the debt there by getting court approval.', ""And so the creditors will be forced to come to the table, talk openly about this with the knowledge that there's a big stick over their heads if they don't come up with some kind of agreement. The other big stick they have here is that all lawsuits will be on hold for several months while these debt terms are worked out. So it's really going to be talking to the fiscal oversight board or nobody."", 'Well, while these things are all being ironed out, will Puerto Rico make any payments?', ""Well, that'll be the question for the oversight board to determine. There was a $2 billion payment due that Puerto Rico just did not make. And creditors have no recourse now except to go to the oversight board and talk to them about how they can get repayment done."", ""Now, the oversight board will also take charge of the island's budget. They'll require a balanced budget. They can order certain departments be cut. They can order layoffs, they can order assets of Puerto Rico to be sold. So they can determine how to raise the money to start paying back this debt and then go to the"", 'creditors and say, what terms can we work out with you?', ""But also included in the bill signed by the president is a lowering of Puerto Rico's minimum wage. Why is that in there?"", ""Well, that's a controversial provision that many people on the island fought against, and Democrats fought against that. It was a Republican idea. Supporters believe that it will help address the island's high unemployment rate."", 'You know, the unemployment rate there is at nearly 12 percent, which is more than double the national average. The idea was to try to kick start employment by getting more young people into the workforce.', ""During these years of crisis, taxes have been raised, public services have been cut, hundreds of thousands of people have left the island for good. Will this appointment and the provisions of this bill help what's been dogging Puerto Rico over the last 10 years?"", ""Well, it will certainly help. What it does is it buys time. But everyone from the president on down say, this is not the solution. This is just a temporary respite of this crisis that has Puerto Rico by the short hairs. The idea is now that while we work out these repayment schedules for the debt, let's take other action to address its health care problems, its economic problems."", ""And the president and others have been calling on Congress to go back to work on Puerto Rico now and take up these other issues. But just this issue of coming up with this oversight board took Congress many months of working on and a lot of heavy lifting. So it'll be interesting to see how quickly they want to go back to take up this issue of working on Puerto Rico, which as we mentioned at the top, is a place that Congress likes to ignore."", ""That's NPR's Greg Allen.

I know Joe. I trust him.', 'The question now is whether Fighting Joe Dunford can navigate the political battlefield of Washington. Two years ago in Kabul, Dunford, a graduate of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, spoke of his approach to dispensing advice.', ""Typically, you know, I don't provide my recommendations for best military advice in public. And I don't share the details and negotiations in public. That's just how I do business."", ""But in Washington, you can't always work behind the scenes.

Aaron MacLean is a former Marine infantry officer who's with the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news website."", ""He argued, I think justifiably and honorably, that a total departure from Afghanistan would lead to a total collapse of that country. He argued that before Congress. I presume he argued it privately with the president himself. And we haven't withdrawn totally from Afghanistan."", 'But Dunford is still a team player.

Our Friday political regulars, E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution and David Brooks of The New York Times, are here to talk about the massacre and also its political implications. Welcome back to both of you.', 'Good to be with you.', 'Good to be here.', ""President Obama, sadly, has a lot of experience now responding to this kind of event. There have been more than a dozen major mass shootings during his presidency. Yesterday, he went to Orlando, met with survivors, family members, first responders. And here's part of what he said afterwards."", 'Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual, like those in Aurora and Newtown, to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons, and they can do so legally.', 'And, at the same time, of course, Democrats staged an all-night talkathon to try to force action in Congress. E.J., do you think this will all amount to anything?', ""I think it is actually a turning point, whether we see action next week or we see action down the road because I think this has exposed a contradiction in the conservative argument. They say that we have to do everything - whatever it takes to fight terrorism - but we don't want to do anything substantial to keep guns out of the hands of potential terrorists. Thus, their proposal on keeping guns away from people on the terrorist watch lists from Senator Cornyn is basically ineffectual."", ""And I think the fact that Senator Chris Murphy led that filibuster shows that supporters of gun control are not on the defensive anymore. They realize that there's been a slow change in opinion because of Sandy Hook and so many other killings and that the killings in Orlando, I think, adds this element of, we really are supposed to be fighting terrorism; why aren't we doing anything about guns?"", ""David, do you think there's been a change in opinion, and will it translate to a change in policy?"", 'Nope.', ""No, I - there's been some change in opinion. Gun legislation's always been reasonably popular, but there's a veto block in Congress in the Republican Party. And they believe gun rights are rights and they can't be taken away without some due process and there are some real restrictions. And that's their argument."", ""My own personal view is I would support all the gun rules. I would certainly support withholding guns from people on terrorism watch lists and such, but I don't think they do much good. I don't think there's much evidence they do much good."", ""And in this particular case, this guy got his guns legally. This guy was actually investigated by the FBI twice. He went through some screening, which is more than any gun legislation would do. It's just really hard to predict black swans - a guy who's on a pathway to this kind of mass murder."", ""Let me just defend my, from my point of view, optimist - relatively optimistic view. Again, I don't think we're going to overturn the power of the NRA tomorrow morning, but you're seeing among Senate Republicans a realization that they can't just do the same old thing. They are allowing a couple of votes in the wake of the Murphy-led filibuster. Whether they would've done that or not, it shows that they are sensitive. They have at least engaged in some negotiations on the issue of people on the terrorist watch list getting guns. So I think you're seeing the ice break. And Donald Trump sending out that tweet saying..."", ""Yeah, saying he'll meet with the NRA to talk about how to keep guns out of terrorist hands."", ""Right, and there's much reason to be skeptical about whether he will go beyond what the NRA already supports, which, as I say, would be ineffectual. But I think the fact that Trump felt a need or a desire to put that out suggests that he's well aware of this contradiction that his side is dealing with."", ""We've seen a lot of prominent Republicans say this is not an issue about guns; it's an issue about terrorism. We don't have any evidence that the shooter in Orlando coordinated with any organized terrorist group, although he apparently did call 911 and pledge allegiance to ISIS. David, do you think there is a gap in America's terrorism policy here that needs to be filled?"", ""Well, I don't really fault the FBI and the people who screened him and didn't catch this. As I say, these are - these are extremely unusual cases, and it's very hard to predict human behavior. I think this is primarily a social and psychological problem. Whether it's the shootings of this sort or the shootings we've seen in Sandy Hook and elsewhere, it's always a lone male."", ""It's always a guy who suffered some sort of injury, who's socially isolated, who's fallen through the cracks, who's decided to blame others rather than himself for the injury he's felt, who wants to feel some heroic sense of grandeur and grandiosity, grasps onto an ideology that justifies an act of violence and revenge on society. The pathways are pretty similar. And I think it's up to us as citizens to look around for, basically, young men in our midst and say, is this person potentially on that pathway?"", 'So is the counterterrorism step that needs to be taken just - if you see something, say something?', 'Well, see, I - we could go on on this argument forever. There are - every country in the world has troubled, socially isolated people in it. We are the country that produces more events like this than any other. And the only obvious difference between us and other democracies is the fact that our gun laws are so weak.', ""Of course better gun laws are not going to stop all of this. Of course we should pay attention to the problems that people face, worry about mental health. I still come back to the fact that you can't kill all these people if you don't have an semi-automatic weapon."", ""We've got just a couple of minutes to talk about the response from the presidential candidates, so let's listen, first, to part of the response from Hillary Clinton."", 'The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive. And we must attack it with clear eyes, steady hands, unwavering determination and pride in our country and our values.', 'And a very different tone from Donald Trump.', ""The Muslims have to work with us. They have to work with us. They know what's going on. They know that he was bad. They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad. But you know what? They didn't turn them in."", 'David, this sounds like a tone from Trump that Republican leaders had hoped was in the past.', ""Yeah, it's a bigotry. Its group - they - who's the they? It's as if all Muslims are one thing and - who know. And, you know, Trump was himself. He congratulated himself on his own genius, and then he displayed bigotry."", ""What I thought was important just in the Trump campaign is that he's really taking a hit in the polls. There's mild panic now in the Republican Party. And I was looking to see whether his ratings would rise after Orlando, and they have not. So I think that's a sign that people are not rallying to him out of a sense - any sense of xenophobia."", 'And on the flipside, E.J., what do you think this said about Hillary Clinton - her response - as a presidential candidate?', ""Well, her response was the normal response you would get from a presidential candidate. It was tough, as a presidential candidate would be, and it was addressed to the problem. I think, to go back to Trump, David's right. And the problem Republicans have is they'd like to dump him - many of them would. But the party itself is for him and his ideas."", 'Sixty-two percent of Americans reject a ban on Muslim immigration. Fifty-six percent of Republicans are for it. Seventy percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump. Sixty-five percent of Republicans view him favorably.

A gunman there killed 49 people and wounded dozens more."", 'The president has been meeting with survivors and the families of those who died, and he has just delivered a speech in Orlando. As he said earlier this week, the president is again saying this is a time to reflect on how to end the violence and discrimination against the LGBT community. As soon as we have audio of his comments, we will bring that to you.', ""We're going to hear now from two people who have been watching President Obama respond to mass shootings throughout his two terms. Joining us by Skype is Corey Ealons. He's a senior vice president at VOX Global, a Washington public relations firm. And before that, he served as communications adviser to President Obama. Thanks for being with us."", 'Thank you all.', 'And here with us is NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott.', 'Kelly, good to be with you.', ""So there's obviously a lot of symbolism attached to this visit. What is the message that president Obama wants to send?"", ""Well, it's partly personal. The president said he held and hugged the grieving family members in Orlando today, but it is, as you say, also symbolic. He is sort of standing in for all the people in this country who have been moved by what happened in Orlando and who want to, in some way, show their support for that city and those families that are grieving."", 'And Scott, this is sadly a kind of visit that the president is all too familiar with.', ""I have accompanied the president when he's made these kinds of trips many times, you know - Aurora, Colo., Newtown, Conn., Charleston, S.C. The list goes on and on. The president has been personally touched by those visit, and he certainly shares the grief of those who've lost loved ones. Also, as a president and a policymaker, he has to think seriously about what we might do as a country to respond to these attacks and make them more difficult."", ""One of the things he said today is that while the motives of the gunman in some of these different mass shootings might be different - maybe it's mental illness in one case; maybe it's hate or terrorism in another; maybe it's motives that are known only to that individual - the instruments are similar. And he has said repeatedly that one thing for us to think about as a country is how easy it is for people who are bent on this kind of mayhem to get their hands on dangerous weapons."", 'And Corey Ealons, I want to turn to you. How have you seen the president change over time as he responds to these attacks?', 'Well, the first response he had was after the Fort Hood incident. And because that was on a military base, even though it was a tragic incident, he was responding to folks who were serving in the military, so that takes on a very different vibe. You could actually see him physically and mentally begin to shift, emotionally begin to shift when the Sandy Hook incident occurred. I mean, we all remember him standing at that podium, wiping back the tears from his eyes, trying not to cry, trying to collect himself as he was giving his comments from the briefing room in the White House.', ""And then of course just last year in Charleston, he just simply broke down. He just simply decided he could not contain the emotion he felt because he's moved from a period of trying to console the nation and console the families to also being visibly angry about these situations each time they occur. And you saw that again just this week."", ""So Corey, as you describe that progression, you know, it's hard not to notice that these were also different targets, whether you talk about a school, a black church, a gay nightclub. What are you going to be listening for in the president's comments in Orlando today?"", ""Well, I think today is unique because it is an attack on one community, on the LGBT community. And we know how much tremendous progress we've made in civil rights for that community over the past several years, so I think we're going to hear a specific message for those folks as well and how - recognizing how they've come together as a community not just in Orlando but all over the country. We've seen them embrace each other and decide that they're going to do something about this. And I think you're going to see the president acknowledge that today."", 'And Scott, not only the fact that this was - that the LGBT community was the target in this attack - the gunman also pledged allegiance during the attack to ISIS. How do you think that colors this visit?', ""Yes, so there's a lot of different cross currents in this particular incident. But the president was very quick to acknowledge that this was a particular community that was targeted. He said on Sunday that this was particularly heartbreaking for our fellow Americans who are gay and lesbian. And in simply recognizing that and describing the LGBT community as our friends and fellow Americans, the president was making a statement about the place that community now has in the American community - not always true when gay bars have come under attack in the past."", ""And then you're absolutely right. The fact that this is - that the gunman in this case pledged, in the midst of the attack, his allegiance to ISIS adds another wrinkle and certainly provides sort of another boogey man for the country to focus on as we try to wrestle with how to deal with these sorts of attacks."", ""Let's listen to a little bit of the president's remarks from earlier this week. We have that tape."", 'This is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. No act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.', ""And Scott, the president also met with law enforcement during this Orlando visit. Again, it's not the first time he's made that a priority, right?"", ""That's right. He wanted to express his thanks for the folks who rushed into the club and, in this case, did help to rescue dozens of people who were being held hostage there. We also expect the president to pay tribute to the doctors and nurses who cared for the wounded and the ordinary people - the friends who were in the club, perhaps, or the folks who came out to the club later to help their neighbors and their friends."", ""He'll talk about how communities rally at times like this, the outpouring of support we've seen from people who were in the club, around the club, the numerous people in Orlando who stood in the hot sun for hours to donate blood. As the president's motorcade made its way through Orlando today, you could see some of the symbols of that community support - large rainbow flags and a sign outside a Harley-Davidson dealer saying simply, pray for Orlando."", ""You know, Corey, you talked about how the president actually feels very emotionally connected to these events, and he also has a role to play as the country's leader when Congress is debating policies surrounding guns and so forth. How does he balance those two roles?"", ""Well, I mean, that's exactly right. I mean, the first priority in these speeches is to console the families and the communities - the local communities - and to give them solace. The second point is to console the nation, to give them some sense of hope coming out of tragedies like this. But then the final thing - and I think that you're going to hear this today as well more overtly - a political message that this is something that we can do. We can fix this if we decide to act in Washington. So I think you're going to hear that overt message coming from the president today as well."", ""That's Corey Ealons, senior vice president at the PR firm VOX Global who was a communications adviser to President Obama earlier in the administration - as well as NPR's Scott Horsley. Thanks to you both."", ""You're welcome."", 'Thank you, Folks.']","['ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'KELLY MCEVERS, HOST', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'COREY EALONS', 'KELLY MCEVERS, HOST', 'SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE', 'KELLY MCEVERS, HOST', 'SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE', 'SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE', 'KELLY MCEVERS, HOST', 'COREY EALONS', 'COREY EALONS', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'COREY EALONS', 'KELLY MCEVERS, HOST', 'SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE', 'SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'KELLY MCEVERS, HOST', 'SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE', 'SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'COREY EALONS', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE', 'COREY EALONS']"

The president has studiously avoided that phrase, saying it merely reinforces the terrorist narrative that the U.S. is at war with Islam."", ""There's no magic to the phrase radical Islam. It's a political talking point. It's not a strategy."", ""This semantic argument didn't start with Donald Trump. Plenty of other Republicans have criticized the president's word choice, and Obama typically shrugs it off as so much partisan rhetoric."", 'And that kind of yapping has not prevented folks across government from doing their jobs.', ""But Obama says what's new and potentially dangerous is where such anti-Muslim rhetoric can lead. Not only has Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors to the U.S. Yesterday he suggested Muslims already here are complicit in attacks like those in Orlando and San Bernardino."", ""The Muslims have to work with us. They have to work with us. They know what's going on. They know that he was bad. They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad. But you know what? They didn't turn him in."", ""Where does this stop, Obama asked today. Should all Muslims in the country be subject to special surveillance? He challenged Trump's fellow Republicans to say whether they agree with the GOP standard-bearer. Some, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, have already distanced themselves."", 'Obama notes the U.S. was founded on the values of religious freedom and pluralism, and he accused Trump of betraying the very qualities that make this country great.', ""If we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims with a broad brush and imply that we are at war with an entire religion, then we are doing the terrorists' work for them."", ""Obama insists he won't let that happen.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both made statements as well.,"[""It is the worst mass shooting in American history. At least 50 people are dead, and 53 more have been sent to area hospitals. Joining us now for the latest on this story is NPR's Scott Detrow. Scott, thanks so much for speaking with us."", 'Thank you.', 'President Obama spoke earlier today from the White House. What did he have to say?', 'Well, President Obama was cautious. He said that when it comes to the motives and ties to broader terror networks, investigators are still looking into this. President Obama did reach out to the LGBT community saying attacks on any Americans is an attack on all Americans. And the president also talked about gun control. And frankly, he sounded a little bit dejected.', ""Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well."", ""You know, the president has spoken more than a dozen times after mass shootings. He spent a lot of his second term trying to get some sort of gun restriction passed. It hasn't happened, and you could hear that frustration and anger."", 'And what about the candidates from the major - the two major political parties? What have we heard from them today?', 'Well, Hillary Clinton is being much more careful than Donald Trump. Like Obama, she did talk about gun control in her statement, saying, quote, ""this is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States. It reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets."" Donald Trump is being much more combative. He\'s attacking Obama for not doing enough to prevent terror attacks. And he\'s almost saying I told you so.', ""Here's a line from his statement. (Reading) If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we're not going to have a country anymore because our leaders are weak. I said this was going to happen, and it's only going to get worse."", ""And he didn't say this in the full statement that the campaign released. But on Twitter, Trump seemed to double down on the temporary ban on immigration from all Muslims that he called for in the wake of the San Bernardino shootings. That's something that as it's gone from the primary to a general election, some of his staff has suggested was not something that Trump fully supported. But here on Twitter, he appears to be endorsing that position again."", 'But what would be the relevance here? Because the suspected shooter, the only one that the FBI has identified so far, is an American citizen. He was born in this country. So what would be the relevance?', ""That's a good point. He is an American citizen. But what Trump talked about was criticizing the Obama administration. His argument is that allowing people to come into the country allows potential ISIS sympathizers to infiltrate the country."", 'I understand that some people might not consider it appropriate to talk about politics at a time like this. And yet, you were telling us earlier that an event like this can change the tone and focus of the presidential campaign. Tell us how so.', ""Well, on a small level it's already affecting the schedule of what was going to happen over the next week. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were going to hold their first campaign event together. This was going to be a big moment for the Clinton campaign. That's since been postponed. It just doesn't feel appropriate at the moment. But looking at those San Bernardino shootings, they definitely affected the Republican primary. We saw Ben Carson's lead evaporate because voters just didn't seem to trust him with foreign policy and national security."", ""At the time, Donald Trump benefitted from that. The question is would he now? It's a much different electorate. It's the whole country instead of just Republican voters. Hillary Clinton is, of course, a former secretary of state. And we have some recent polling from The Wall Street Journal and NBC showing a wide lead for Clinton over Trump when it comes to who voters want to - would trust with foreign policy. It was 56 percent to 29 in Clinton's favor."", ""And she's also made a point about temperament."", 'Yeah.', 'She has said explicitly in political speeches and her speech marking her being named the presumptive nominee and having captured enough delegates to claim that title - she doubled down on the whole question of temperament. Do we have any sense of whether temperament is something that the voters are thinking about now?', ""I think it's an argument that the Clinton campaign is going to be making over and over again over the next few months. You saw a bit of it in the big commercial that she announced today. And just look at their - both responses on social media to get a sense of the different approaches - Hillary Clinton being very cautious, saying we're waiting for the facts to come in. Donald Trump is making declarations saying this is tied to radical Islamic terrorism. We need to do something.

In fact, I don't think there's ever been someone so qualified to hold this office."", 'And he says he cannot wait to get out there and campaign for Clinton.', 'E.J., how do you describe their relationship?', ""You know, I was thinking of how fierce competitors who confront each other and come to respect each other - Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain, maybe someday Steph Curry and LeBron James - and I think there's something like that going on with Obama and Clinton. There's also the fact that the Clintons did two big favors for Barack Obama. She took the job of secretary of state, which was a unifying thing. The best defense of Barack Obama in 2012 was probably Bill Clinton's speech at the Democratic National Convention, and now they have a powerful shared interest because Obama's legacy will really only be secured if a Democrat - and that will be Hillary Clinton - is elected president. So I think he had his heart in this but he also had a lot of self-interest invested in making sure she wins."", ""David, do you think it'll help her to be seen as being so close to Obama as opposed to being an agent of change?"", ""Yeah. He's 20 points more popular than she is in some key states - some of the New England, New Hampshire-type states where he's popular and she's much less popular. She had a great week. You know, all the endorsements came in - Elizabeth Warren, Obama. You're seeing the gathering of the chieftains of the Democratic Party. And it was a great, inspiring week, but this is not a great year for chieftains. And so I'm not sure how much endorsements will help her, especially because I still do not think she has a purpose to her candidacy that general election voters know about. And so I'm mostly struck, frankly, by how weak she is in the polls given all that's happened. When you do the three-way polls, she's down, in some of them, 39, 40. Trump's in the middle. And then Gary Johnson's surging to 10."", 'The Libertarian candidate.', ""Right. So you're beginning - so the two main candidates are so weak, you could have a third-party candidate. I really think it's plausible. I think Gary Johnson could get up and if he gets a role and actually runs a good campaign, he could get to 12 and, I mean, a significant candidacy."", ""I think there is a chance for a strong third-party showing just on the basis of the low approvals. But you already saw Hillary Clinton start climbing up this week. She's just coming out of the competition with Bernie Sanders. A Democrat I talked to said, look, at worse, this is the imperfect versus the insane is how the Democrat sees the fight between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. And in the last couple of weeks, Trump has fed into that Democratic narrative. And, you know, it's interesting, a year ago or six months ago, Barack Obama's endorsement might not have meant as much, but his popularity has steadily gone up. And he's very important, as Bernie Sanders will be, in turning out the younger voters she still needs 'cause I still think Obama has strong standing with younger Americans that she doesn't yet."", 'Let\'s turn to a complex Republican relationship - one that you write about today, David - Donald Trump and his party\'s congressional leaders. The Speaker of the House Paul Ryan called Trump\'s comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel textbook racist remarks. But then later, on ABC\'s ""Good Morning America,"" he reaffirmed his support of the nominee.', ""Here's the question I ask - do I believe that these principles and these policies that flow from those principles have a better chance of making the law with Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton? Absolutely, I do believe that."", ""David, you wrote today, Paul Ryan and the Republicans can try to be loyal to Trump, but he won't be loyal to them."", ""Yeah, I think Ryan's position is completely untenable. It's untenable first in a working - and just pragmatically. I wrote today that being loyal or united with Donald Trump is like being united with a tornado. It just doesn't work. Trump is a sole diva. He betrays and belittles and degrades everybody who's tried to befriend him. So he doesn't do the cooperation thing, and so you can't be loyal to that. And then Ryan's position is just morally wrong. To be united with a person on policy grounds even though you think he's a racist is to invert the normal values of humanity. The normal values of humanity and of candidates is that culture and character come first, and that's fundamental and foundational, and candidates have to pass a basic threshold as a decent human being before you can even think about their policies. And you can't paper over a moral chasm because you agree with their tax reform plan."", ""But can you imagine, is there a position for Paul Ryan? I'm speaker of the house, I'm chairman of the convention, I'm highest-elected Republican official. I don't support the party's nominee. Is that conceivable?"", ""I think that's where he'll get to the point where he nominally supports the nominee but they run an entirely separate campaign because there's no cooperation and no reciprocity Donald Trump."", 'E.J., what do you think about it?', ""I mean, endorsing Donald Trump means always having to say you're sorry. And this is going to happen over and over again in this campaign. You know, and one edition of the New York Daily News took those quotes and the front cover of the Daily News was, I'm With Racist. That's not a cover that that Paul Ryan is going to say, but Trump has Republicans in a box because if they can't seem to get rid of him as the nominee without splitting the party, he's got support from enough of the Republican base, probably 50 or 60 percent of the party, that if they oppose him they're going to face real problems turning out their own voters or winning their own voters in their own races. But if they don't back away from him, they may face other problems in the fall. This is a terrible, terrible problem for them, and I think that Ryan's difficulty in, you know, his anomalous combination of sentiments reflects this awful bind they're in."", ""Yeah. And I would just say it depends on what you think of this moment. If this is a temporary moment, Trump goes away, then maybe you can hug him and go on with the rest of your life.

Dionne of the Washington Post and the Brookings Institution and David Brooks of The New York Times. They discuss the presidential race and President Obama's visit to Hiroshima, Japan.","['Here to talk more about the campaign and other things are our weekly political commentators, E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and David Brooks of The New York Times. Welcome to both of you.', 'Good to be with you.', 'Good to be with you.', ""All right, so we just heard that if Hillary Clinton loses California, it won't change the delegate math. But still, the question is how bad would it be for Clinton? E.J.?"", ""It would not be good. Mo Elleithee had a good line at the end of that piece - math beats momentum every time. That's true, except in the media and except in - among nervous Democrats, who are always ready to push the panic button. I think they have it sort of taped down permanently. And, you know, what they want to do is win California and New Jersey on the same night and say, OK, Bernie, now is the time for you to start working with us. I think that the California primary is about which message people want to send. Bernie wants them to send a message to the party and the country - and antiestablishment message and a message that the party should move in a progressive direction. Hillary Clinton, as she said, wants to send a message that the Democrats are uniting against Donald Trump. I think her desire to get votes against Donald Trump are probably going to be her best asset in trying to beat Bernie Sanders out there."", ""The State Department's inspector general released a report this week that said Clinton did not seek legal approval to use her private email server. There were also three new emails released. How could the timing of these questions affect her in California and beyond? David?"", ""Well, it'll certainly affect California and beyond, and it'll certainly affect beyond. Listen, it's baked into the cake that people think she is dishonest. And this was not - it's not, like, qualitatively different what we learned from this report, but it's a few extra bricks on the wall. She didn't get permission. She stonewalled the investigation. And she very deliberately chose to have this server. It was not some accidental thing because it was inconvenient to have two phones. So that does underline the, you know, she'll stoop to anything or she plays by her own rules line. And I have to say, even listening to the clips that we just heard from her, she has - goes after Trump for being dangerously divisive, but the rhetoric is stale. Trump's- you know, his evil genius is that he's really good at picking a word to summarize somebody - little Marco Rubio, lying Ted Cruz, crooked Hillary Clinton. It's just one word. It's a powerful marketing message. She's just not as good at that kind of thing as Trump is."", ""Of course, nobody is, incisive David. You know, I mean, there just isn't anybody's who's used that kind of negativity against other people. I mean, poor lying Ted. That's going to stick with him forever."", 'I thought sexy David would be better.', 'Never satisfied, never enough.', ""This week, Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee after some delegates pledged their support, of course, getting him to that magic number of 1,237 delegates. And then there was the question of whether House Speaker Paul Ryan would endorse Trump or not. The two did talk on the phone, but then Ryan later said he was not endorsing trump. Here's what he had to say about the state of the Republican Party after that phone call."", ""What I'm most concerned about is making sure that we actually have real party unity, not pretend party unity - real party unity because we need to win this election in the fall. There's just too much at stake - the Supreme Court - on and on and on I could go. The point is, I want real party unity, and that's what I'm most concerned about."", 'OK, guys, what does he mean by real party unity here?', ""Well, I think that Woody Allen had a movie once where he had people speaking English with English subtitles. And the English subtitles said what people were really trying to say. And I think you hear Paul Ryan over and over again say, do I really have to endorse this guy? I really don't want to do it. I think he knows that he may have to get there in the end. And he knows that if he does, he is essentially going to be walking away from a whole lot of the things he's said he believes in. So I think Ryan hates what's going on, which is why he keeps kicking this endorsement down the road. And he talks about unity because he doesn't really want to bring it about, though he knows he has to."", 'So this is a reluctant Paul Ryan, David?', ""It's like watching somebody be asked Henry VIII's fourth wife. It's just, like, a bad job prospect. And so he's sort of compelled to do it, but you can see he doesn't want to. And what he means by party unity, I think, is party disunity. I think, eventually, he's going to want to separate the Republican Congress from the Republican nominee and have as much disunity and mental distinction in the minds of voters as possible."", ""This - oh, could I just say quickly, I think that this is a real bind Trump is putting a lot of Republicans because, for months and months, Republicans talked about how unacceptable Trump was as a candidate. They criticized all the outrageous things he said and did. And now they're being forced to endorse him. And when they don't, Trump goes after them as he went after Susana Martinez this week, which I think was really quite surprising - except that it's Trump - because it did him absolutely no good. It's not going to speed up her endorsement, and, oh, by the way, Donald Trump's going after another woman politician."", 'You know, another thing Ryan talks about is that, you know, rather than the bitterness and the anxiety, this campaign should focus on the issues. He put out - you know, he talked about putting out his Confident America agenda this week about the economy, taxes, healthcare, poverty. But, you know, people are responding to the anxiety on the campaign trail and not necessarily talking about the issues. Is that going to hurt Ryan?', ""Well, it's the issues in the issues. I mean, Ryan is a great and a good political leader. He still has a bit of the problem that, frankly, a lot of the Republican establishment has, which is he cut his teeth at a place called Empower America, which was a very Reaganite think tank in the 1980s and '90s, I guess. And - but his ideology is still, very reasonably, traditional Reaganite. And that's what Trump just slaughtered. And so if Ryan's going to really answer Trump, he has to be post-Reaganite, frankly, the way Trump is, but hopefully in a different flavor."", ""And of course, today, President Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima. He laid a wreath there. He gave a very moving speech calling for a moral revolution. Let's hear a little bit of that."", 'But among those nations, like my own, that hold nuclear stockpiles, we must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them.', ""Pursuing a world without nuclear weapons - as one Hiroshima survivor said to me yesterday, the U.S. is spending more than a trillion dollars to upgrade its nuclear arsenal. I mean, that does not sound like an administration that's willing to live in such a world. E.J.?"", ""Well, you know, early on, Obama reached an agreement with Russia designed to reduce nuclear weapons. He pursued the agreement with Iran. I thought this was a really powerful speech. And I think it's good for the United States that Obama went to Hiroshima. You heard again the moral balances he keeps trying to talk about. He talked about man's capacity to do evil can lead us to war. And yet, we must possess weapons to defend ourselves. I think he's tried for a kind of moral realism that Reinhold Niebuhr - the philosopher - the theologian David and I both admire - preached. And I thought you heard that loud and clear today in Hiroshima."", 'Quickly, David?', ""Yeah, well, fortunately, he's not reducing our nuclear stockpile. He's done it less than the two Bush administrations. And I think that's a good thing because the nuclear weapons do stabilize things."", ""That's David Brooks of The New York Times and E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post. Thanks to both of you."", 'Thank You.', 'Great to be with you.

NPR looks at the political significance of the visit and the tricky line Obama will have to walk.,"['On August 6, 1945, America dropped a new kind of bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. As President Truman told Americans that day, it was the first use of an atomic bomb.', 'We have used it in order to shorten the agony of war, in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young Americans.', ""One-hundred-and-forty-thousand people died. Most of them were civilians. And tomorrow President Obama will become the first sitting American president to go to Hiroshima. He will lay a wreath in honor of the dead.

Hi there."", 'Good to be with you, Kelly.', 'So Scott, the White House has been very clear that President Obama will not apologize for the bombing or second-guess President Truman. So what is he hoping to accomplish with this trip?', ""You know, Kelly, the administration is acutely aware that this president has been wrongly accused by Republicans in the past of conducting apology tours, and they've gone out of their way to head that off. The President told Japanese broadcaster NHK it's appropriate for historians to ask questions about the decision to drop the atomic bomb, but in the midst of war, leaders make all kinds of decisions, and he's not going to try to put himself into President Truman's shoes."", 'Instead, Obama says, he wants to call attention to the fact that in war, generally, innocent people on all sides suffer. And he wants to bring some new urgency to his campaign against nuclear weapons.', ""The job's not done in reducing conflict, building institutions of peace and reducing the prospect of nuclear war in the future."", 'During his first visit to Japan seven years ago, President Obama said he would like to see Hiroshima. What took him so long from then to now?', 'This is a dicey diplomatic challenge for the President. Most Americans approve the decision to bomb Hiroshima, but by an even larger majority in Japan, most people say the bombing was unjustified. So Obama is going to have sort of a fine line to walk here.', 'A fine line, sure, but who is the tougher audience?', ""Well, obviously the president doesn't want to offend his host, but of course it's American opinion that really counts. The administration is especially wary about offending veterans who fought in World War II and their families."", ""In fact, National Security Adviser Susan Rice sat down shortly after this trip was announced to talk with veterans groups and try to explain what the president is up to. We expect Obama will pay tribute to America's World War II veterans both in Hiroshima and again on Monday when he observes Memorial Day here at home."", ""Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be with Obama on this trip tomorrow. He will be there when Obama lays this wreath for the victims. What's he saying about the trip?"", ""The prime minister has said no apology is expected or needed here, but he welcomes the president's visit. Abe spoke about this through an interpreter earlier this week."", '(Through interpreter) What does Japanese people suffering from the atomic bomb desiring is never to repeat such tragedy in the world. And I understand that the upcoming visit by President Obama to Hiroshima will no doubt create further powerful momentum toward realizing a world free of nuclear weapons.', ""Abe and other Japanese leaders have been accused of minimizing their own country's conduct during World War II. The prime minister told reporters this week he has no immediate plans to visit Hawaii later this year for the 75th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, but he did note that he visited the World War II Memorial here in Washington last year and pledged a wreath there in honor of all those who died during the war."", ""That's NPR's Scott Horsley.

They wanted an equal say over their children, over their property, their earnings, their inheritance, equal rights to their citizenship and a say in their government, equal opportunities in schools and universities, workplaces, public service and yes, equal pay for equal work.', ""The two women whose names now grace the house are Alva Belmont and Alice Paul. That's Alva Vanderbilt Belmont, a well-known socialite who used money from a divorce to bankroll the Woman's National Party, and Alice Paul, who was the party's mastermind and founder."", ""Paul was a radical figure in her day. She earned a PhD in economics and later moved to England, where she got involved with the militant wing of the women's suffrage movement there. After returning to the U.S. in 1913, she picketed the White House, was arrested, even went on hunger strike. Jennifer Krafchik manages the collection of documents and artifacts at the Belmont-Paul National Monument."", ""She was really in the thick of the fight. And when women were granted the right to vote in 1920, Alice Paul actually drafted the original Equal Rights Amendment and its updated text later in the '40s. So she spent her entire life, really, working for women's rights, women's equality. She worked for equal pay. She worked for the right for women to serve on juries. So just a really amazing woman."", 'This is a legacy President Obama hopes visitors will take with them as they come and go.', ""After women won the right to vote, Alice Paul, who lived most of her life in this very house, said, it is incredible to me that any woman should consider the right for full equality won. It has just begun. And that's the thing about America - we are never finished. We are a constant work in progress."", ""President Obama at the dedication of the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument on Capitol Hill today.""]","['ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST', 'JENNIFER KRAFCHIK', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST']"

Among those he singled out for praise Thursday was journalist Robert Cox, then editor of the Buenos Aires Herald, who helped to reveal the disappearances, torture, and murder of leftists and others under the military junta. NPR's Robert Siegel talks with Cox about his work during that period.","[""Argentines are marking the 40th anniversary of the military coup that set off the Dirty War, a seven-year-long wave of political oppression that claimed thousands of lives. President Obama, who's just returned from a visit to Argentina, acknowledged the victims of the Dirty War there earlier this week. And he also acknowledged some of those who stood beside them."", 'The journalists, like Bob Cox, who bravely reported on human rights abuses despite threats to them and their families.', 'Robert Cox edited the English-language Buenos Aires Herald. He ultimately had to leave Argentina. He moved to Charleston, S.C. But at age 82, he now returns regularly to Buenos Aires, and he was with the president there this week. He joins us now from Argentina. Welcome to the program.', ""Thank you. It's a great pleasure to be here."", 'Take us back those days 40 years ago. Political dissidents were, in the phrase of the day, being disappeared. You were a newspaper editor. You faced a choice about how to cover what was going on. What led you to act as you did?', ""What I realized was is that we could save lives. That sounds extraordinary, but it is what happened. And we had to just find the ways to do it in such ways that the government wouldn't deal with us as they dealt with other people. The point was to get the story out, too, because, with that, we were able to occasionally - well, fairly frequently, really - get the government to release people. I have friends now who survived the torture chambers there because I wrote a story about them. It's an incredible - so many incredible stories like that."", 'The way that the Buenos Aires Harold managed to do this was actually quite fascinating. The idea was, if the families of people who had been disappeared filed a writ of habeas corpus, then you could cover a legal action in court - the filing of the writ and report on the content of it- and get away with it.', ""We decided that's what we would do, and we did get away with it. It was chaos in that time. It was like some vortex of horror in Argentina, but most people managed to not see what was happening. One of the things that I take away with it is the ability of people to compartmentalize everything according to how they want to feel most comfortable."", 'You married into an Argentine family.', 'Yes.', ""Clearly you must've known a lot of people or been in-laws to a lot of people who thought what was going on was OK."", ""Yes, of course they did. And they dropped us. I'd be walking in the street, and they'd cross to the other side of the road so they wouldn't have anything to do with us. We had that problem, and then we had wonderful, dear friends who remained with us and around us. Social events were very difficult sometimes. And my wife used to try and bring it up. We tried to tell people what was going on. They didn't want to know. My wife says that she would say, do you know that people are being taken out at 3 o'clock in the morning and not coming home? And they'd say, what nice shoes you have. And, you know, it was that - it was a very strange time in every way. And I never got the right word to describe everything. You know, perhaps I will get it one day."", 'There had been a dictatorship in Argentina - the Peronist regime - before all this. And the coup that led to the Dirty War was - well, it was targeted, I guess, at supporters of the old regime, leftists, Jews. Who else was - who was on the list that the generals had?', ""Jews got worse treatment than anybody else. I was - yesterday, I was at the Jewish social center, and we were talking about that. It's possible to use the word genocide in that it was a political genocide. It was a genocide that sought certain people they thought were not proper Argentines, which of course would include Jews, include people like me, include all kinds of people. And so you would have to be a good Catholic, and you would have to be extremely right wing, and then you were OK. And then you could live very happily under that regime."", ""For younger journalists who might find their countries, or their communities for that matter, violating norms of civil and legal behavior and might find some of their friends being OK with that, what's your advice?"", 'Never, never, never, never, never, never, never. One has to absolutely be totally principled about this and not accept it in any form.', 'Well, Bob Cox, thanks a lot for talking with us.', ""No, thank you very much. It's an enormous pleasure to talk to you. Thank you very much for NPR. What we need here in Argentina is NPR."", ""Thank you.

Dionne. They cover President Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court and the latest on the presidential race.","['What a week - presidential primaries with consequential results and a Supreme Court nomination whose results are very hard to foretell. On Tuesday night, Hillary Clinton won big.', 'This is another super Tuesday for our campaign.', 'Thank you, Florida. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you, Ohio.', 'And later she won Missouri.

I think it would be - I think you'd have riots. I think you'd have riots."", ""If all this weren't enough, President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, widely-respected centrist appellate judge, to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. As he told our own Nina Totenberg..."", 'My goal was to actually confirm a justice who I thought could do an outstanding job, and Merrick Garland fits that bill.', ""But only a handle of Senate Republicans have agreed to even meet with Judge Garland, and Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said that he had spoken by phone with the nominee but hadn't committed to a meeting."", ""What I said to him was you call back and we'll talk about it at that point. I expect him to call back. I'll take that conversation, and I'll decide what to do at that particular point."", 'What a perfect week to wrap up with our Friday regulars, E.J.

I think they might do it by text if they're not going to make phone calls to each other. Apparently that's too much. But here's the only scenario where I see it happening - I don't think there's going to be enough political pressure to force the Republicans into it. But if they're down by 15 points and Donald Trump is the nominee, Garland is the best thing they're going to get if there's a Hillary Clinton presidency. Garland is a model of judicial restraint. He's pretty moderate. He's the best any Democratic president..."", ""You mean from a Republicans, he's the best..."", ""From a Republican point of view, he's, like, the best. And so if they figure they're going to lose, I would go ahead and confirm him. Why not?"", 'E.J., you agree with that scenario?', ""I agree that's a possible scenario. I should say to listeners, as I've said to people who read my column, Merrick Garland's an old friend going back 40 years. And he is a delightful human being. And I think that part of him - and you can see people saying that right, left, center -Sen. Angus King, the independent of Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, said a wonderful thing. He said, what are Republicans afraid of about meeting him, that they might like him too much? And I think the president made a choice which is to put somebody there who is a relative moderate, who believes in judicial restraint and basically said to the Republicans how can you reject this guy? I'm not baiting you with him."", ""But do you think he's saying that because he honestly expects them to confirm him - the way David described they might - or to put them in a box politically?"", ""No, I think that he's - Merrick Garland's been on Obama's list three times in this. And so Obama generally respects him. Pretty much everybody respects him. And I think, you know, there's an underlying issue here, which is conservatives have been criticizing liberals for years for being judicial activists. And now I think it's conservatives who have become the judicial activists on everything ranging from the Voting Rights Act to Citizens United. And Merrick Garland really puts them on the spot because exactly as David said, he is a believer in judicial restraint. So I think you'd have a very interesting and surprising debate if they actually went through with hearings."", ""Let's turn to the presidential races, and I want start with David and the Republicans. David Brooks, you wrote an anti-Trump column today - not your first, I should note. And on the subject of not having seen Trump's appeal early on, you wrote this - (reading) for me, it's a lesson that I have to change the way I do my job if I'm going to report accurately on this country. Elaborate."", ""Well, you know, I didn't - I wrote many columns saying he would not get the nomination."", 'And you did mention that here as well.', ""Yeah. And I have probably said on this microphone many, many times. And so it looks like I was wrong. And I think it's because I wasn't socially intermingling with the sort of people who are Trump supporters. So I knew they were hurting. I didn't know they were hurting - they were going to express their hurt by supporting Donald Trump. And so in the years ahead, I've got to spend a lot more time with different sorts of people. And I've decided I guess to - I'll spend a lot more time going to Aspen, Vail and The Hamptons."", ""And that's..."", ""No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding."", ""That's exactly - I mean, David's exactly right. There is - you know, the - I've always said that the biggest sort of bias in the media is more a class bias than it is an ideological bias. And I think that the Trump phenomenon came as a surprise, although again, I think we should look back. And when you saw that the Republican Party has depended for so long on white working-class voters and has delivered remarkably little, an explosion like this should have been foreseeable. But no one expected that Donald Trump would be lighting the stick of dynamite."", ""I'd like to hear what both of you think, briefly, of the various stop Trump schemes - either the convention that blocks his nomination, goes to a second ballot or the third-party run that somehow - as in 1912 - hands the - you'd rather keep the integrity of the Republican Party than win the White House."", ""Yeah, I - first, I'm struck by how few Republicans are actually signing on to the Trump juggernaut - Christie, Rick Scott in Florida but very few. And so they're holding off. But on the other hand, they're not mobilizing really anything effective. There was talk of a third party, but nobody's got the gumption. Trump, for all his faults, has a monopoly on our destiny this year. And nobody else is really offering anything. And so they can talk and they can moan, and to me it's maybe the sign of a psychologically defeated party."", ""I don't really disagree with that, except that I think there's one candidate who would insist that he has a lot of audacity, and that's Ted Cruz. And I think that's what makes the Trump - stop-Trump effort so complicated because if you ask Republicans who besides Trump don't you want to win the nomination? A lot of the same Republicans who are anti-Trump - not all of them but a lot of the same ones are anti-Cruz. You're starting to see some break toward Cruz, even among people like Lindsey Graham, who once said choice between Trump and Cruz is a choice between poison and a firing squad..."", 'Yeah.', ""...Where he's now decided to pick his poison and is raising money for Cruz. And it really probably will require a rallying to Cruz, even though John Kasich had a good night in Ohio."", ""Hillary Clinton is looking increasingly like the Democratic nominee. David, you earlier just mentioned a scenario whereby the Republicans, if they nominate Trump, are down 15 points in the polls. Do you think that he would be a very weak candidate against Hillary Clinton or be as surprising in the general election as he's been in the primary season?"", ""I think he'd be exceptionally weak. He's - in the latest NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, he's down 13 to her. That's a huge gap. If you look at his favorable-unfavorable ratings, one of the things that's striking is they've been utterly consistent for eight months since he announced his campaign. He's, like, 60 percent unfavorable. And now she's also underwater. She's got higher  unfavorable ratings than favorable. So it's the first time we'll have candidacies where both major candidates are unfavorable. But he's tremendously unfavorable. Among women in particular, he just gets crushed. And so I think he'd be a pretty week candidate."", ""And E.J., what's the current Democratic thinking about him? He's the weakest candidate the Republicans can offer or he's unpredictable and could be strong?"", ""My friend Michael Tomasky observed something that I started noticing that Democrats tend to emphasize how Trump could beat Clinton with his strength in Midwest industrial states. Republicans are petrified that Clinton will destroy Trump because of her strength in the suburbs and the middle-class. This shows A, that both parties are paranoid, and B, it shows which constituencies they're actually worried about. And I think that's - we're going to be debating that for a while."", 'E.J.

Here in Washington, President Obama delivered his final State of the Union address. In South Carolina, Republicans met for their latest presidential debate, the most fiery one yet. And in Iowa, caucuses are just a couple of weeks away. To discuss all of this, we're joined by Mary Kate Cary, who's a columnist for U.S. News & World Report, and Joy-Ann Reid, who is a national correspondent for MSNBC."", 'Welcome to both of you.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', ""Let's start with last night's debate, where the biggest fireworks were between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Here they are debating whether Cruz is eligible to run for president having been born in Canada. Let's listen."", ""Listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court, and, I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump."", ""You don't have to."", 'Take it from Laurence Tribe.', ""What I'll tell you also..."", 'Take it from your professor.', ""Mary Kate, you were a speechwriter for the first President Bush. Is it fair to say - you've got your roots in the establishment Republican camp. It sounds like if you were looking for somebody to eclipse Trump last night, it didn't happen."", ""I would say that's right."", ""And so is there any hope left for the establishment Republicans to get their guy get in there or do they just have to come to grips with the fact that this is going to be a race in which Trump and Cruz and the other people on what's considered the fringe of the party are going to seize the day?"", ""Well, for most of the establishment Republicans I've been talking to, I think step one right now is bargain with God. Start begging."", ""Step number two, though - you know, the RNC officially can't do anything. They're supposed to just be the referees here. So the party officially is not going to step in. So of the crowd that I am familiar with, their response is to get to Iowa and New Hampshire. For example, there is a huge crowd of longtime Bush family supporters, and they're all going up to New Hampshire the weekend before the New Hampshire primary and they're going to go door-to-door and work the phone banks and anything else they can do - sit in diners, talk to people. And that's the answer. I assume Rubio people are doing the same thing, I assume Christie people are doing the same thing. And that's what's going to turn it around in their minds. That's how to fix it."", ""Joy, there were a couple of lines in the debate last night about president Obama that rankled a lot of people. Chris Christie called the president a petulant child, and Ted Cruz said, we're going to kick your rear end out of the White House. And some observers said, you'd never make that remark about a white president. What do you think?"", ""Well, I think that gets to the kernel of one of the many ironies of the situation that the establishment of the Republican Party finds itself in because right - so Chris Christie is a part of that establishment wing, but he speaks about the president in such a degrading way as if the president is a child and not the commander in chief of the United States - such a disrespectful way. That's suborned the kind of rage and the kind of paranoia, frankly, that you see among the base of the Republican Party. The problem for the establishment is that they've lost control of it. They suborned things quietly like birtherism. They winked and nodded at ideas like death panels. They have sort of allowed this kind of fury and paranoia to help them win midterm elections, but it's now out of control. So they've both locked themselves out of even the possibility of reaching out, particularly to African-American voters, who read the entire Republican Party - not just Donald Trump, but all of it, every single part of it - as being essentially sowing hatred of the president based at least in part on race. And that bleeds over to Hispanics, it bleeds over to Asian-Americans. It creates a vie that the Republican Party can't fix, and Donald Trump is just better at them at exploiting it."", ""Mary Kate, you're shaking your head. You're looking quizzical."", ""Wait, wait. (Laughter). I think, Joy, there are certainly elements of what you're saying that are true, but it seems to me that you're painting with a very broad brush. And there are plenty of good Republicans in the world who are not dealing in hatred and vitriol and racism. And I do think over the last few years when we have these candidates who say these crazy things - the birtherism, you know, things like that that you pointed out - there are people who stand up and say, I disavow that, I don't agree with that."", ""But unfortunately, those people don't seem able to speak for the party in the primary right now - unfortunately for them, unfortunately for the establishment Republicans."", ""Right. Yeah. It's a lot more fun to watch Donald Trump, you know, on TV with all this craziness coming out of his mouth than watch somebody disavow it. So that's why."", ""Let's move on to the other big political story this week, President Obama's final State of the Union address, where he talked about one shortcoming of his presidency. Let's listen."", ""It's one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better."", 'Joy, why do you think President Obama has been so unable to bring Republicans into the fold?', ""I think it was partly on the part of the president of the United States. Barack Obama is - he's accustomed to the way he was able to deal with the other party in Springfield, Ill., where he could go down state and play cards with Republican members and essentially build alliances on the ground that he could then take back with him to the floor of that body. But you have to remember that he also had the support of the president of the Senate. His mentor, Emil Jones, ran the party at that time. He ran the Senate at that time, the state Senate. And so he had a lot of back up and he was able to make those deals because it was Republicans who were in the minority and had to make deals to get things done. I think that the president, because he's grown up in this milieu where he's been able to talk across racial and party lines, presumed he'd be able to do that in Washington. But the fact is that the opposition party made a decision when he first got into office - literally the day of the inauguration, there was a meeting among members of the Republican caucus to include Paul Ryan, to include Kevin McCarthy, who decided that total obstruction was the way they were going to go. I mean, you know, Vice President Joe Biden talks about this, that he would go to his - even his friends in the United States Senate, and they'd say, we can't vote with you, we can't agree with anything that you want to do. Even when they put forward essentially Bob Dole's 1996 health care reform idea, Republicans couldn't vote for it. They couldn't vote for anything. It was total obstruction."", 'Well...', 'And so I think he was speaking into a void and the president neither deployed fully his rhetorical gifts to try to fix it, nor I think, would it have been very effective, given the strategy on the other side.', 'Well, Joy, if you put a lot of the blame on Republicans, my sense, Mary Kate, is that you think Barack Obama himself stands to blame for alienating Republicans early on.', ""I think what started it - here in Washington, at least. I can't speak to the Chicago part like you were, Joy - but in Washington, those first two years when he had both houses of Congress with him, he had absolutely no incentive to reach out to Republicans. And so that sort of started the muscle memory and I think he - he canceled the Congressional barbecues, there weren't movie nights. All the things that used to sort of keep people at the table giving each other the benefit of the doubt have all disappeared under him. And I think that you sort of reap what you sow. And what bothers me is, for example, when he said in the State of the Union peddling fiction and political hot air and things like that, that is very divisive language, and it makes the other side not want to come to the table."", 'That\'s Mary Kate Cary, former White House speechwriter and columnist for U.S. News & World Report and Joy-Ann Reid, MSNBC national correspondent and author of the new book, ""Fracture: Barack Obama, The Clintons, And The Racial Divide.""', 'Thanks to both of you.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.']","['ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'JOY-ANN REID', 'MARY KATE CARY', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'TED CRUZ', 'DONALD TRUMP', 'DONALD TRUMP', 'TED CRUZ', 'DONALD TRUMP', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'MARY KATE CARY', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'MARY KATE CARY', 'MARY KATE CARY', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'JOY-ANN REID', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'MARY KATE CARY', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'MARY KATE CARY', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'JOY-ANN REID', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'JOY-ANN REID', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'MARY KATE CARY', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'ARI SHAPIRO, HOST', 'JOY-ANN REID', 'MARY KATE CARY']"

Has the outcome actually been so definitive?', 'Well, just as President Bush spoke too soon declaring mission accomplished in Iraq, I think Obama may have done the same with Afghanistan. He promised to withdraw half of the 9,800 U.S. troops there by the end of last year. Instead, he left troop levels unchanged.

U.S. troops were pulled out from there a few years ago, but more than 3,500 are now back in Iraq, where the U.S. is also carrying out daily airstrikes. It's part of the new war the president's launched against the Islamic State both within Iraq and Syria.

They don't want the planet's average temperature to go more than two degrees above what it was - 2 degrees Celsius, that is - above what it was pre-Industrial Revolution. Now, that's the target but it's not going to be enough, and everybody knows that. So what they've done is they've said, let's come back every few years and get together and say, OK, we can do better."", 'So what happens next?', 'Well, this has been arranged carefully by the legal minds in the State Department and the White House such that it may not have to go to the Senate to be ratified.

The FBI is investigating signs that the married couple behind the attack was inspired by the self-described Islamic State.

Scott, thanks for being with us."", 'Good to be with you, Lynn.', ""Now, the president is speaking from the Oval Office tonight, and that's something he's only done twice before. What kind of message is he trying to send with this speech?"", ""President Obama will try to communicate to the American people that the government is doing all it can to keep them safe. Now, you're right, the Oval is not a backdrop that this president uses very often. He's only given two televised speeches there before. And both of those were all the way back in 2010, the first during the Gulf oil spill and then later when the president formally ended combat operations in Iraq. Neither of those is a moment the White House probably wants to relive. But the Oval Office is perhaps the most solemn setting available to the president, and aides say they know Americans are in the mood for a little resolution and reassurance after attacks that felt every close to home - first in Paris and, of course, now in San Bernardino."", ""You can't can help but wonder though how much reassurance the president really can offer. I think people are really worried about the idea that there are killers out there - would-be killers like this who are operating below the radar."", ""Yeah, this is a real challenge for political leaders because on the one hand, people want to feel safe when they go to a ballgame or to a concert hall or to their office Christmas party. And on the other hand, as the president said, after the Paris attacks it's very difficult to guard against killers who are willing to sacrifice their own lives, especially if you live in a Western country that is not a police state and even more so in a country like the United States where guns are easy to come by. I expect tonight we're going to hear some echo of what the president said in his weekly radio address, which is that Americans should take whatever steps we can to minimize the threat but also cautioning against any kind of bunker mentality."", ""That's how we can send a message to all those who would try to hurt us. We are Americans who will uphold our values in our free and open society. We are strong and we are resilient and we will be not be terrorized."", ""Scott, do you expect the military campaign against ISIS will come up tonight in this speech? The president's gotten a lot of criticism from Republicans and some Democrats about the way he has pursued the military campaign."", ""Yes, Lynn, we expect the president will again express his determination to destroy ISIS, using not only military power but also steps to cut off financing and efforts to counter the group's ideology. But you're right, critics have been calling for a more robust military response. We heard Ted Cruz call for carpet bombing ISIS until the sand glows. Of course, Donald Trump has used similar rhetoric, and that has a real political appeal to a certain percentage of Americans. At the same time, there are those who say goading the U.S. into a military overreaction would just hand ISIS another propaganda win. We do now have France, Britain and Germany stepping up their involvement in the military campaign. But as the president said in Paris last week, additional airpower only goes so far until you have a better sense of the targets you're trying to hit. You know, San Bernardino shows ISIS is willing to strike indiscriminately. So far, the United States and its allies are not."", ""NPR's Scott Horsley.

It hasn't been updated since.","[""U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria fall under the same legal authority Congress granted president George W. Bush to combat terrorism after the September 11 attacks. That authority hasn't been updated since. President Obama brought that up in his Oval Office address last night, using his preferred acronym for the self-proclaimed Islamic State."", 'If Congress believes, as I do, that we are at war with ISIL, it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of military force against these terrorists.', ""NPR's congressional reporter Susan Davis joins us now to talk about why Congress isn't doing that. Hey there, Sue."", 'Hey, Audie.', 'So the president sent Congress a request for a new war authorization back in February, and that outlined the military mission against ISIS. So what happened after that?', ""Well, in short, nothing has happened in part because there really hasn't been much sense of urgency about why Congress should act now. The request that the president sent to Congress earlier this year - it essentially did three things. It limited the mission to airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. It put restrictions on sending any critical mass of ground troops in. And it had a sunset provision in there so the authority would expire in three years."", ""But when the White House sent up that request, they'd already begun their bombing campaign. So they were asking lawmakers to approve military action they were already taking. And it muddied the administration's case for why Congress needed to vote."", ""Now, to mention, the president's request also did not repeal that 2001 authorization that's been - was approved after 9/11. That's what gives the president very broad and unending authority to combat terrorism and undergo these military missions. And the administration has made it clear that they believe they have the existing legal authority to take this action with or without Congress. And to that point, the U.S. military has dropped over 20,000 bombs on ISIS since the military strikes began over a year ago."", ""OK. So there are lawmakers who say, why do we need to do this; you're already taking action. But there are, of course, still many members who say, this is an important debate, that it's their constitutional responsibility to take tough votes like a war authorization. So what's going on? Why isn't this actually moving to the floor?"", ""There is a small group of lawmakers, notably led by Virginia Democratic senator Tim Kaine and Arizona Republican Jeff Flake, who say just that - that they want to try and at least force lawmakers to debate this. But the reality is, Congress doesn't really want to take this vote. Party leaders - and in both parties - are not really confident that they can pull together the kind of bipartisan coalition that you'd want to see on a vote of this magnitude. Republicans say President Obama's request has unreasonable restrictions on the Pentagon's ability send in troops if they needed to, and Democrats are incredibly skeptical of voting to enhance any authority that would put more troops on the ground in the Middle East."", ""Where there is apparent agreement is that maybe it's better not to act at all and let President Obama continue the campaign on his terms and have full ownership of the strategy."", 'But to go back, something you mentioned there about ground troops - there is increased polling showing some support for that. Any chance that will prompt Congress to act?', ""There is a view that Congress just can't continue to avoid this debate altogether. And we don't know how future events might shape this conversation. But right now, we're in the midst of a presidential race, and Republicans who control Congress would much rather be having this debate with a Republican in the White House. So there is a sense that, yes, Congress may have to take another tough vote defining this war on terrorism, but the debate may just have to come under the next president."", ""That's Sue Davis, NPR's congressional reporter.

The FBI is allowing people to come get their cars that were left in the parking lot here since the shooting occurred on Wednesday. They're being escorted by police and all that. The parking lot and building itself, though, are still both technically closed and under federal control since they're investigating this as an act of terror."", ""What's going on with the investigation right now?"", 'Well, the FBI says that the bulk of the investigating now will be focused on tracing the digital fingerprints of the two shooters - Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. What that means is they\'re going to try to find out who Farook and Malik were interacting with online and on two smashed cell phones police found at the scene. The FBI says they believe Malik had pledged her allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State on social media around the time of the attack. And in a radio bulletin, the Islamic State says that the two shooters were, quote, ""supporters"". But they did not claim to have planned or ordered those attacks. And the FBI has been very clear in saying that they have no proof that either Farook or Malik had any contact with terrorist groups or extremist cells before the attack. They do say, though, that their investigation is showing signs of radicalization.', 'And how is the community dealing with all of this at this point?', ""Well, it's hard to get a sense of how everyone's handling it.

Dionne of The Washington Post. Good to see you both.', 'E.J. DIONNE: Good to see you.', 'Good to see you.', ""Since Wednesday, we've been hearing the country's political leadership react to San Bernardino. Yesterday, President Obama was very cautious in choosing his words. In the Oval Office Thursday morning, he was not ready to call this terrorism."", ""It is possible that this was terrorist-related, but we don't know. It's also possible that this was workplace-related."", 'Some Republicans showed no such reticence, nor did Hillary Clinton, who was campaigning last night in New Hampshire.', ""We will learn more about what went on and who these people were and what their motivations were. But it's becoming clearer that we are dealing with an act of terrorism."", ""By this morning, the semantics of the event were rendered moot with news that Tashfeen Malik, the woman suspect, had declared her loyalty to ISIS. How to speak of it, how to react to this, how to prevent anything else like it - all of that has been under discussion this week. And I'd like to hear from the two of you, what of all this has made sense or not made sense to you? E.J.?"", ""Well, I guess I wasn't surprised that President Obama was very reluctant to declare this a terrorist event before it was confirmed because that carries an enormous implication. I mean, we have largely avoided events like that. The other thing that's really struck me is, yes, at a certain level, it matters greatly whether it was a terrorist act because that has foreign-policy implications. On the other hand, it would have been an equally awful act if it had not been terrorist-related. So are we suddenly living in a world where we have the normal shootings in our country that seem to happen on a regular basis, and we don't worry about those as much unless we call them terrorists? And I found that kind of disturbing."", 'David, what did you think?', ""Well, this was a terrorist act. It was an act of religious terrorism. And I think we're going to see an upsurge of religious terrorism in this century because we're going to see an upsurge in extremist forms of religion. And that's not because religion is bad, but religion creates groups. And there's some small, fringe minority in each group that want to kill people outside the group. And I - Rabbi Jonathan Sacks wrote a book recently saying that the answer to religious terrorism is going to be found within religion and reinterpreting the text, and it's going to be done by religious people. Religious people listen to other religious people. And what has to happen is - we already have a theology of loyalty and love for people within the group. There has to be a theology of justice for people outside the group. And so it's up to religious leaders to really show how you can love your own group, but you've got to treat others with a form of justice. And I think it's - this is a war of ideas as much as anything else."", ""I thoroughly agree with that, and I admire Rabbi Sacks, as well. But also, you wonder if this will make us start thinking about the same laws that we talk about to prevent other forms of gun violence, other forms of mass shooting. Will we suddenly take those laws - the possibility of such laws more seriously now that we're more worried about this sort of terrorism? In the Senate last week, it didn't seem so. There was a provision proposed that if you're on the no-fly list, you've got to be restricted in buying guns. That didn't pass. So you can't fly, but you can buy a gun. That seems odd."", ""Well, as people raised the point, they said, here is a couple that wasn't on any no-fly list. Whatever might have been done to prevent people accused of terrorist links from getting a gun or doing anything else wouldn't have stopped these people. They don't seem to be mentally ill. There's no record of hospitalization. And none of the steps that have been proposed, except for just saying, look, it should be a lot harder to buy a gun - that seemed to be about the only..."", 'Which seems a sensible idea to me.', ""I mean, it seems sensible to me, especially the guns they used. Any gun that makes you look like Rambo-esque, you don't need to have it. But the other thing that has to happen is ISIS has to be deglamorized. I mean, here's a woman sitting out in San Bernardino, Calif., suddenly decides ISIS is going to give her life some meaning. And it has to be deglamorized by humiliating, and that means defeating it on the battlefield the way al-Qaeda was more or less defeated. And that's part of the project, too."", ""OK, on to Republican presidential politics. Ben Carson appears to be dropping in the polls. And he didn't help himself yesterday at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition. In his description of the two major Palestinian factions, Dr. Carson pronounced Hamas in such a way as to suggest hummus, a Middle Eastern chickpea mash."", 'The challenge is the split between Fatah and Hamas. Fatah and Hamas operate in a constant state of conflict. Fatah rules the West Bank. Hamas rules the Gaza Strip.', ""I just couldn't resist playing that. He didn't quite same hummus, actually, but it cane close. David..."", ""It's better than the split between Fatah and matzo."", '(Laughter).', 'Or the Tabbouleh insurgents in Afghanistan, perhaps.', ""Well, Carson is dropping out of the top tier, it seems, in the polls. David, you write today that you expect Donald Trump to lose the lead as Republican caucus-goers and primary voters get more serious. The ink was barely dry on my New York Times - reading your column - when CNN released a poll that shows Trump up 36 - with 36 percent the vote - 20 points up on Ted Cruz. What's going on?"", ""Hey, well, if you ask me where I'm going to eat February 1, I'll give you an answer. I love a restaurant called Cookshop in New York. Maybe I'll be there, but I'm really not thinking about it. And so who knows where I'll be on February 1? So that's the way voters are right now. Eighty percent of them - you know, we pay intense attention to this - 70, 80 percent of them are not thinking about it. So if you ask a question, they'll give you an answer. But if you go back to the last Iowa caucuses, the last New Hampshire caucuses,  people make their mind up in the last 30 days. And they think very differently about it when they're actually choosing a president and when they're just trying to name somebody who makes them feel good at the moment."", ""But they've been naming the same person now since July. This has been a pretty strong run in the polls."", ""Right, but Trump does - he makes them feel good because he's obnoxious. They get to feel that he's going to shake up Washington. He says things that are - seem bluntly true to some people. But when you actually think about the nuclear trigger, when you actually think about running the government, I just don't think a party that has chosen Mitt Romney and Bob Dole and John McCain has suddenly changed personality that much."", ""You've just mentioned three people, E.J., who did not get elected president. That's part of what's happening here. What do you think, E.J.?"", ""Well, I guess I take Trump's supporters more seriously than David does. I want to say that I do not think Donald Trump will be elected president if he wins the Republican nomination, but I was very struck, as well, by that CNN/ORC poll. And the reason I think Trump has staying power is that he has built a very definable constituency. Ben Carson's gaffes have lost him support because there was never strong support for him, whereas in that poll, Trump is getting 46 percent among Republicans without college degrees. He has become the spokesman - a billionaire has become the spokesman for Republican working-class discontent. And if I had a dollar for every time people said Trump will fade after Labor Day, Trump will fade after Thanksgiving, I could buy a lot of Trump's properties. I think he's got staying power."", ""David, I won't ask you to pay E.J., but you get the last word in defense of your column."", ""(Laughter). Well, listen, if - Nate Silver did a very good thing because you've got to measure how much uncertainty there is in this. And if we reflect the uncertainty in the actual poll - undecided, 80 percent, Trump, 5 percent, Rubio, 3 percent - that is the reality. People have made a decision, but it's a provisional decision, like just trying on clothing."", 'David Brooks of The New York Times, E.J.

Investigators say the couple was on a mission."", 'Kelly, they sprayed the room with up to 75 rounds. Fourteen people died, 21 wounded. And local police say they actually caught a break because a jerry-rigged remote control car that was set to detonate three pipe bombs never exploded. The suspects, of course, died in a shootout in their rented SUV four hours after that episode and a hail of gunfire they exchanged with 23 officers on the scene.', 'As we said, this investigation is now being led by the FBI with help from local law enforcement partners. What is law enforcement doing right now?', ""The FBI flew in a team from Washington, D.C., to help reconstruct the crime scene. They're collecting evidence at that site and at the site where the suspects were killed, and they're flying some of that material back to the FBI lab back in Quantico, Va. Here's David Bowdich, the assistant director of the FBI based in Los Angeles."", ""The digital media is incredibly important because we are trying to determine the motive. And we're hoping that some of that digital media exploitation will help us in obtaining some of that. Again, it would be responsible of me, and it would be way too early for us to speculate on motive."", ""Kelly, I'm told by federal officials briefed on the investigation that the male suspect had some kind of social media contact with people overseas who've been on the FBI radar. But there are really big questions right now about how significant that contact was and what it all mean. So far, the FBI has been very clear. There's no determination he was directed to act by people overseas."", 'And what do we know about the weapons that these suspects used?', ""That's another important part of this ongoing investigation.

Here to discuss all that is David Brooks of The New York Times, joining us this week from Philadelphia. Hi, David.', 'Hello.', 'And also, Amy Sullivan of Yahoo News is here in the studio. Hi, Amy.', 'Hi, Ari.', ""Let's start with Trump. We have a clip here from a rally on Tuesday where he mocks a reporter named Serge Kovaleski, who has a degenerative joint condition. Trump is using an article that Kovaleski wrote 14 years ago to back up the false claim that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated after 9/11. Let's listen."", ""Written by a nice reporter. Now, the poor guy - you've got to see this guy. Oh, I don't know what I said. Ah, I don't remember. He's going, like, I don't remember. Maybe that's what I said."", ""So not the first time Donald Trump has mocked a reporter - also not the first time he's made a claim that isn't supported by the facts. But, David, this seems like a new level on both counts."", ""Is it? Well, he hits new levels. He started a new level, and he keeps hitting them. I think for me the big question - is Trump for real? You know, he's been on top of the polls for about four months doing antics like this, and nothing seems to hurt him. So is he for real? And I still think the answer is no. When you look at Iowa, New Hampshire in years past, when the voters made up their mind, they made up their mind in the last couple weeks. Eighty percent of the voters made up their mind in the last couple weeks. So it's important to remember that if - when you look at the polls, of course they'll give you an answer if you're asking who did they vote for. But those votes - at least 80 percent of them - are still undecided. And it just boggles my mind that when they actually do decide on something real they're going to go for Trump. So I'm sticking with the camp that all this is just a pregame mirage."", ""Well, Amy, do you think this is wishful thinking on David's part? I mean, people thought Trump would fade after the Paris attacks. They thought Trump would fade at the end of the summer. People kept thinking Trump would fade, and he hasn't faded."", ""He hasn't faded, and I think the Republican Party very much hopes that he will. They're hoping that this is just kind of a flash in the pan. And yet, he keeps sticking around. And as far as we can tell from polling, his outrageous statements, which keep topping each other one after the other after the other, are not pushing away his core supporters. Now, whether he has anything more than what seems to be a ceiling of about 20 percent is still up for grabs. And we will know as the field starts to narrow or continues to narrow even more - farewell, Bobby Jindal - where Donald Trump has some room to grow or whether you'll see other candidates coming in."", 'Speaking of other candidates, Ben Carson made an interesting move this week. He left yesterday evening for Jordan to visit with Syrian refugees. And, of course, this happens as Carson takes a lot of questions about how much he knows about foreign policy. David, do you think this trip to refugee camp in Jordan will help?', ""Yeah, we'll see if he can find Jordan. You know, I think..."", 'That sounds like a no to me.', ""I think he's - he, unlike, Trump - Trump has had some downswings, and then he's come back, which demonstrates some resilient. Carson, his numbers have not shown that resilience. When he starts sliding, so far the slides have continued. And his level of lack of knowledge on some of these foreign-policy issues can't be cured by a single trip to a refugee camp."", 'But it is an interesting move when most of the Republican Party is talking about closing the doors to refugees, Amy, for a Republican presidential candidate go to a refugee camp in Jordan.', ""Yeah, well, and especially someone who is comparing refugees to rabid dogs just last week. You know, Ben Carson - I don't think anybody knows what he's doing, including Ben Carson. But it's true that he is, as time goes on, starting to look more and more like what we saw a lot of in 2012 on the Republican side, where Michelle Bachmann would be at the top of this polls, and then she'd drop and Rick Perry would do the same thing and then she'd drop - he'd drop. Herman Cain was, at one point, the Republican frontrunner."", ""I remember somebody memorably describing it as the Angry Birds candidacy, where one after another, they were go up and then plummet down. Well, before the family turned their attention to turkey pardons and pumpkin pies, President Obama hosted the French leader, Francois Hollande, at the White House this week. Let's listen to a bit of that."", ""We're here today to declare that the United States and France stand united in total solidarity to deliver justice to these terrorists and those who sent them and to defend our nations."", ""This week, Hollande also visited Moscow to try to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to focus on defeating ISIS. But also this week, Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet near the Syrian border. So, Amy, when it comes to Syria, the fight against ISIS, would you say things are moving in a better or worse direction after this week's events?"", ""I would say it's still a complete mess and continues to get a little more complicated. You know, you've got Turkey going after Kurdish fighters who are fighting ISIS. You've got the Russians bombing moderate Syrians who the U.S. would like them to stop bombing. Apparently what has come out of the meeting between Hollande and Putin is Putin requested a map of the people he shouldn't be bombing and said, well, you know, once you can get that to us, sure, we'll stop bombing the people we think we shouldn't be. You know, this continues to be just kind of a morass. And it was hard to know what to make of the meeting between Hollande and Obama because there's not much that the U.S. is willing to do right now - or can do - more than offer verbal support. Joe Biden said at one point, like, we haven't just been doing most of it; we've been doing it all. We've been doing 95 percent of the airstrikes in Syria."", ""David, what would you say? There's a lot of activity, but what direction is this actually moving?"", ""Listen, this thing is only going to be resolved - ISIS is only going to be weakened if the Sunnis on the ground - the normal Sunnis - take arms against it as they did against al-Qaeda in Iraq, you know, five or six years old. And that's only going to happen if Assad is taken out. As long as Assad is basically committing genocide against the Sunnis, the Sunnis are going to stick with ISIS. And so the idea that we can have some alliance with Putin, who's Assad's main backer, is a chimera (ph). And so we can have an alliance with France, and hopefully we can have an alliance with the Turkmen and some of the people on the ground, but we can't have an alliance with Putin because his interests are diametrically opposed to ours. I thought what happened with the Turks and the Russians was the big story here. It showed that, in a vacuum, all the people with old, historical claims - and, of course, Turkey has historical claims on Syria - are leaping in and trying to fill the void. And so it seems to me that the fount of strategic clarity here is thinking, of course we've got to get rid of ISIS. But we can't get rid of ISIS unless Assad is gone. And so there has to be this very complicated two-track policy which simply cannot involve Putin because he's against that policy."", 'Last item I want to ask you about just briefly - with a climate conference starting in Paris next week, 200 countries meeting, Republicans in Congress threatening to shut down the government over money to poor countries for climate change. David, is shutting down the government becoming a standard political tool these days?', 'Threatening it seems to be, over everything from Planned Parenthood to climate change but if you look at polls of Russian - I mean (laughter) Russian - Republican voters, they hate the idea of shutting down the government, so they may oppose some of the climate measures. But the idea of shutting down the government, destabilizing the U.S. is very unpopular, even among Republicans.', ""That's David Brooks of The New York Times and also Amy Sullivan of Yahoo News.

He forcefully made this point this morning on the radio talk show of Laura Ingraham."", ""We don't know who these people are or what they're are doing, but we do know they are coming from a nation or a state that is connected with terrorism posing very real danger to the people in this state and in this country. And I sent a letter to the president that said neither you nor any federal official can guarantee that Syrian refugees will not be part of any terroristic activity."", ""From Alabama governor Robert Bentley, I will not stand complicit to a policy that places the citizens of Alabama in harm's way. Michigan governor Rick Snyder, who, earlier this year, expressed his hospitality to immigrants fleeing turmoil in the Middle East, has done an about-face. The Detroit area is home to a high concentration of Middle Eastern immigrants. I've directed that we put on hold our efforts to accept new refugees, he said, until the Department of Homeland Security completes a full review of security clearances and procedures."", 'Refugee advocates say governors do not have the power to pick and choose which nationality of refugee can resettle in their state territory.

She says the average refugee faces a two-year waiting period of intensive background in security checks. Dr. Yahya Basha is a prominent Syrian-American in the Detroit area who's been there since the 1970s and who has family members fleeing the current civil war. Basha says the Syrians who are coming here today are not rushing the borders like we've seen in recent TV images. He says they've been living for years in Jordanian refugee camps."", ""It's not like something somebody just walked in like the way it happened in Europe. Here, there is a process already."", ""Swimming against the tide, the Democratic governors of Pennsylvania, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii and Washington say their states will keep their gates open to Syrian refugees. What's more, Martin Walsh, the mayor of Boston, site of the 2013 marathon bombing by Islamic extremists, issued a statement today saying his city, too, will still accept all refugees.

But some analysts and lawmakers are calling for sending in U.S. troops - thousands of them. And the president took that on. Let's listen."", ""And let's assumed that we were to send 50,000 troops into Syria. What happens when there's a terrorist attack generated from Yemen? Do we then send more troops into there or Libya, perhaps, or if there's a terrorist network that's operating anywhere else in North Africa or in Southeast Asia?"", 'So the president said, let\'s continue the strategy I\'ve come up with of working with rebel groups in Syria and with the Iraqi and Kurdish forces in Iraq in providing air cover for them even though the president said this strategy does not offer the, quote, ""satisfaction of a neat headline or an immediate resolution.""', 'OK. So the current strategy involves trainers. The president said he would send up to 50 special operations forces into Syria to work with local forces there. Is there something short of sending, you know, like the president said, 50,000 troops into Syria?', ""You know, I think there is. Some advocate putting special operations forces closer to the front lines, maybe bringing in Apache attack helicopters to push this thing forward. That's risky, though. It could lead to American casualties, but it's something being discussed both inside and outside of government - sort of a midway course between American advisers and bases in Iraq or sending in tens of thousands of ground troops."", ""And the president's strategy's come under a lot of criticism from Republicans. What does it look like on the ground?"", ""Well, in the Kurdish areas in Iraq and Syria, it seems to be working fairly well. The Kurds are hardened fighters.

Bruce Huber, professor of energy law at the University of Notre Dame, talks about the Keystone pipeline decision.","['We\'ll start by talking about a few minutes at the White House that were nearly a decade in the making. We\'re speaking of President Obama\'s announcement yesterday that he has decided to reject the Keystone XL oil pipeline project. The pipeline would have carried crude oil from Canada to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Reaction to the announcement was what you might expect. Opponents of the project applauded; backers called it an overreaction to environmentalists and a job killer. For his part, President Obama said the issue had taken, quote, ""an overinflated role in our political discourse,"" unquote.', 'This pipeline would neither be a silver bullet for the economy - as was promised by some - nor the express lane to climate disaster proclaimed by others.', 'Well, what about that? We wanted more context so we called Bruce Huber. He is a professor of energy law at the University of Notre Dame.', 'Professor Huber, thanks so much for speaking with us.', 'Absolutely, happy to do it.', 'So how big of a deal is this decision really?', ""Well, in my view, it's not really a very big decision at all. I don't think it would even make my top 10 list of the most significant events for the environment. It's not a decision that has much of an impact on our domestic energy infrastructure. And it's, frankly, not a decision that is going to have that much of an impact on the environment either."", 'How come?', ""Well, it simply was one of a whole mass of pipeline projects that are out there that are either underway or in the inaugural stages. And furthermore, the construction of the pipeline itself was not a major determinant in whether this oil actually comes out of the ground in northern Alberta. If you didn't want to go the pipeline route, you could transport the oil by rail, as we've been doing in great quantities out of North Dakota in recent years."", ""Let me just play a short clip from Bill McKibben. He's an environmentalist, one of the most prominent voices opposing the pipeline. This is him talking to NPR yesterday."", ""This is the first time that a world leader has stopped a major fossil fuel project because of its effect on the climate. It's the first time that the power of big oil's been broken like that even a little, and that's a pretty astonishing thing."", 'What about that, Professor Huber?', 'Sure. Well, I have enormous respect for Bill McKibben and the kinds of efforts that he\'s undertaken. But it\'s clear that what he\'s referring to is the fact that this particular decision had assumed this larger symbolic importance. But I suspect that in cooler moments, he would agree that the actual material\'s substantive output or impact of this particular decision is really not all that large on the grand scale. In fact, there are many folks on the environmental side who would actually prefer that oil is transported via pipeline than via rail because oil by rail is notoriously unsafe.

That effort failed, though. Now that the nuclear deal's in place, Obama says it's time to move on."", ""It's no secret that the prime minister and I have had a strong disagreement on this narrow issue. But we don't have a disagreement on the need to making sure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon, and we don't have a disagreement about the importance of us blunting destabilizing activities that Iran may be taking place."", ""Unlike some of their past meetings, the two leaders took care not to lecture one another in front of the cameras today. Instead, they both stressed the strong partnership between their countries and promised to work together to confront their common security challenges in an increasingly volatile Middle East. Martin Indyk, who's a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, says in that sense, the meeting was a success."", ""This was a meeting in which they would agree to bury the hatchet and not in each other's backs. There's business to be done, and I think they did it."", 'That included a discussion of U.S. military aid to Israel, the chaotic situation in Syria and potential steps to lower the temperature between Israelis and Palestinians.

Instead, the administration is simply trying to keep the hope of a two-state solution alive for a future president. At one point during his reelection campaign this year, Netanyahu vowed there would be no Palestinian state on his watch. Today, though, the prime minister insisted he's committed to the two-state goal."", ""I don't think that anyone should doubt Israel's determination to defend itself against terror and destruction. But neither should anyone doubt Israel's willingness to make peace with any of its neighbors that genuinely want to achieve peace with them."", ""Netanyahu is also trying to make peace this week with Democrats, and his visit to Washington is something of a course correction.

The move comes on the eve of an international climate summit.","[""In a long-running saga of crude oil and sometimes cruder politics, the Keystone XL pipeline has hit a dead end. President Obama announced that his administration will not permit a Canadian company to build the pipeline, a pipeline that would have linked the tar sands of Alberta with the refineries of the U.S. Gulf Coast. NPR's Scott Horsley reports that the president's decision was made easier by a rising economy and falling oil prices."", ""TransCanada's effort to build Keystone has taken almost as many twists and turns at the 1,200-mile pipeline itself would, with lawsuits and legislative battles that dragged on more than seven years. In the end, though, President Obama decided the pipeline would not serve the national interest of the United States and would only encourage development of the western Canadian tar sands that could have an outsized impact on climate change."", ""If we're going to prevent large parts of this Earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we're going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them."", ""The president 's decision was cheered by Nebraska landowners who challenged the pipeline's route and by climate activists around the country.

It's a big win for the environmental movement. It's a big win for our planet."", 'Some say that win is largely symbolic and others were quick to blast the decision, including Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail, and proponents of fossil fuels. Jack Gerard of the American Petroleum Institute accused the White House of putting political calculation above sound science.', ""This decision will cost thousands of jobs. It's an assault on American workers. It's politics at its worst."", 'Obama himself complained the Keystone controversy had been overly politicized on both sides.', 'This pipeline would neither be a silver bullet for the economy, as was promised by some, nor the express lane to climate disaster proclaimed by others.', ""But any fallout from the charge that Obama is turning away jobs was cushioned today by a stronger-than-expected employment report, showing the U.S. added 31,000 construction jobs last month alone. Unemployment fell to its lowest level in more than seven years. The president's choice was also made easier by political changes in Canada with a new prime minister. Justin Trudeau is much less enthusiastic about Keystone than his predecessor, Stephen Harper. Trudeau said today he's disappointed by Obama's decision, but he added the Canada-U.S. relationship is much bigger than any one project. One big factor behind the timing of today's announcement is the upcoming international summit in Paris, where Obama hopes to set an example for other countries to rein in heat-trapping carbon pollution."", ""America's now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change. And, frankly, improving this project would have undercut that global leadership. And that's the biggest risk we face."", ""Critics complain Obama's rejection of the Keystone pipeline may actually end up adding to carbon pollution, as energy companies rely on less efficient trains, trucks and barges to transport oil from Canada. That would have been the case in the fall of 2008 when Keystone first applied for its permit. But since then, the price of oil has tumbled by more than half, making it likely that with or without a pipeline at least some of that oil will stay put in the tar sands.

They'll be based it a headquarters, but clearly they'll be in harm's way. They'll be in northern Syria. And they'll be assessing a large group of Arab, Kurd and Turkmen fighters - collectively, thousands of fighters.

They want to get a sense of how prepared these fighters are, what they need, how's the planning going. Now, the U.S. already has dropped some 50 tons of ammunition to one of these groups. But amazingly, they say they still don't know a lot about them. And we're told that some of these groups could get more equipment, including weapons, but the U.S. wants to first assess them."", ""Tom, can you help us answer the question of why now, especially since President Obama has offered assurances in the past that he would not do this? Here's a clip just from 2013."", 'I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria. I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.', ""He did say that. And the White House says they're still just advisers. But for the first time, U.S. forces will be spending weeks, if not months, inside Syria, and not inside some secure American base. It clearly goes beyond what they've been doing so far, despite what the White House says. And the White House wants to get things moving. That's why they're doing this. The Syrian rebels have gained some ground in the northern part of Syria, but Defense Secretary Ash Carter says, listen, it's a priority to move on Raqqa.

There's also a possibility - nothing firm yet - that American Apache helicopters could be used in the assault on Ramadi. Now, we've been told for about four or five months that the Iraqi forces would be moving on Ramadi. There's been frustration on the part of the U.S. The Iraqis say, listen, there are a lot of roadside bombs, vehicle bombs; it's taking a lot of time.

There are drones. There are attack-aircraft, airstrikes. And now, today, we hear that U.S. forces are going to be going outside bases with local forces.

Perhaps you'll be challenged by their diversity, he said, but Latin-American newcomers will continue to enrich America and its church."", ""That message is likely to cause heartburn for some conservatives in Congress who'll hear from the pope tomorrow. But Francis's words can also give liberal's pause. He stressed the importance today of protecting religious liberty, which is a banner some have used to oppose the requirement for birth control insurance in the president's health care law.

It was a wave election."", ""That's Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. A good ground game can make up one or two points in an otherwise close race, but this late-breaking Republican wave meant many Democrats lost in races that weren't close at all."", ""When you lose the governors' race in Maryland by 10 points - one of the blueist states in the country - it reveals that there's something larger going on than simply whether your technology was good or whether you knocked 10.2 million doors or 10.3 million doors."", 'And what was that larger thing going on? Democrats are sifting through the rubble of Tuesday night for answers. One conclusion, says strategist Geoff Garin, is that even the best ground game only works in service to a powerful message.', ""A lot of those efforts to get out the vote were based on the tactics of voting to get people to vote, but at the end of the day, what's really important is giving people a reason to vote and making them feel like it really makes a difference in their lives and we probably fell short in that regard."", ""Exit polls showed the economy was the number one issue, but says former Obama White House aide Stephanie Cutter, the Democrats' economic message was muted."", ""I don't think that voters heard exactly the critical things that we've done over the last six years - creating millions of jobs, cutting the deficit in half, the graduation rate is up. I think as a party, across the board Democrats could've been talking about those things in a much bolder way."", ""But that's not an easy argument for Democrats to make. The economy is doing much better but people don't feel it. The average family's income hasn't gone up since 1999. Not all the Democrats fault, of course, but still a heavy anchor on the party that's supposed to represent the middle class. In the exit polls, 63 percent of people who voted said the economic system favors the wealthy; a Democratic message if there ever was one, but one-third of those people voted Republican. Geoff Garin points out that voters also supported, by large majorities, Democratic positions on the environment, immigration and the economy."", ""The election was a national referendum on President Obama's stewardship of the economy and not participating in that discussion was costly and states where Democrats lost badly in Senate elections, voters were voting overwhelmingly to pass increases in the minimum wage. For example, policies that Democrats advocate for and Republicans tend to oppose."", ""Beyond that, it's not so easy to draw clear lessons from a small group of races because the data is mixed. In three of the five purple states Democrats had hoped to hold, strong Democratic candidates did run good campaigns, but the results were different. In New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen won. In North Carolina, Kay Hagan lost narrowly and in Virginia, Mark Warner had a near-death experience.

They're not saying that yet, but a senior administration official tells us eventually there are going to have to be some numbers attached to these yardsticks.

Dionne of the Washington Post and the Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of the New York Times. Good to see you both.', 'Good to be with you.', 'Good to see you.', ""And first, let's start with what President Obama said about Israel and the Palestinians. David, what did you make of all of this?"", 'Well, I was Europe when the speech came and the press reaction there and the expert reaction was ecstatic. Finally, a president was spanking Israel, declaring Israel was the primary barrier to peace. Sort of the flip side of the Republican reaction, actually.', 'Not that he actually said that.', ""Right. But that was their interpretation of the speech. I do think that's a bit of an over-read. You know, I think he was more balanced than that. Nonetheless, I do think it's a little obtuse to talk abstractly about the 1967 borders and ignore the specific realities of what's just happened. I mean, Israel did withdraw from Gaza and upset some settlements, and the result was not more peace, it was more wars. A similar thing happened in the north with Israel and Lebanon."", ""And so, the Israeli public is in a certain position right now - skeptical. It's also at a moment in time when Hamas and the PA have formed an alliance. It's also at a position in time when the Arab Spring is really the central issue in the region, not the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, which really has no prospect of being solved any time soon. So, I guess I don't really mind what Obama said. I'm not sure why he picked a fight with Israel at this moment."", 'E.J., what you make of that?', ""Well, I was astonished that people saw him as picking a fight with Israel. I mean, there were two central issues on which he took Israel's side. He said that Israel has legitimate questions about the inclusion of Hamas in the government of the Palestinian Authority. And he also backed Israel's position in the coming fight in September over a Palestinian state. So, there was a lot in there for Israel."", 'And when it came to his statement about 1967 lines, he was just repeating - he was a president, so unlike other officials. Hillary Clinton back in November of 2009 said the U.S. supported the Palestinian goal of an independent and viable state based on 1967 lines with agreed swaps. So, I think the question is - why is Prime Minister Netanyahu picking this fight?', ""Jeff Goldberg writing in the Atlantic, said of Netanyahu, he seems to go out of his way to alienate the president. Why does he do this? My suspicion is that it's Israeli internal politics, but it's sure not helpful to the peace process."", ""Well, the fatal illusion of American policy for Republican and Democratic presidents is that if we somehow got a magic line on the map that we could solve this thing. This is not about territory. It's about moral systems, it's about narrative, it's about something much deeper. And so he, again, falls for the illusion that so many presidents have fallen for - that we just need the right map."", ""Although, I don't think this speech was mainly about a map. In fact, he talked about a lot of those other things in the speech. And a lot of people have just plucked this one line out and made it the centerpiece."", ""He also talked a great deal about the Arab Spring, as it's called. And in the past, this year, David Brooks, you've noted that the president sometimes has been out in front on the Arab revolution, sometimes behind the curve. Here is what he said yesterday about Syria."", 'The Syrian people have shown their courage in demanding a transition to democracy. President Assad now has a choice. He can lead that transition or get out of the way.', ""It's the policy of the times they are a-changing."", ""Yeah, and I thought this was an excellent part of the speech. You know, this was a guy who talks about engaging some of the more dictatorial regimes a couple of years ago but he's recognized what's happened and he's adapted this policy to the Arab Spring, to what's happened. And I think in this speech he did a very nice job of putting American values out front there and saying who we're for, especially in terms of Syria and Libya and other countries."", ""And I think he put the U.S. in a very good position where we can't always affect things the way we want but this is what we believe in, we'll do what we can."", ""Let's go in to some Washington news. Newt Gingrich is running for president in 2012. Here's a man, E.J., who is long familiar with national media and national politics - he's had over a decade to think about running for president - and in a week he seems to have run out of toes to stub on various issues in the Republican field."", 'You know, at this point, it might be more relevant to talk about the impact of the end of the world on the 2012 election than to talk about Newt\'s possibility of becoming president. You know what I think is most unfortunate about this whole thing is I think he meant exactly what he said on ""Meet the Press""...', 'He said...', '...when he...', '...he said the Paul Ryan plan, he was against it.', ""Is a form of social engineering and the American people won't buy it. Why did Newt Gingrich say this? Because he got totally burned by Bill Clinton back in the 1995-'96 budget fight over Medicare. He knows how sensitive this issue is. No Republican has actually come out and fully embraced the Ryan plan, I guess, former Governor Huntsman said he'd vote for it, but I don't expect any Republican to run on this."", ""But it's become, as the Democrats are saying, a litmus test for Republicans. So, now Newt has even denied saying what he said. It's a very strange position he put himself in."", 'David Brooks, did Newt Gingrich reveal his profound weaknesses as a candidate here?', ""Yeah. I mean, he has a fatal weakness for hyperbole, fatal inability to control his ideas, a complete absence of management style. And I think I said on this program I wouldn't trust the guy to manage a 7-Eleven. You know, so he has these world historical ideas, about the seven or eight a minute and they're interesting to listen to, but as a presidential candidate, he's hopeless."", ""But E.J.'s point is a good one, though. This is actually a real debate on the Republican Party. A lot of people are saying that politically it's insane to do what Ryan's doing. I happen to think it's semi-insane but also semi-necessary. But Gingrich didn't come out of nowhere. There's a large talk radio segment saying we should never cut Medicare, we should never cut Medicare, and he was really speaking for that. It's got to be heard in the Republican Party."", ""I want to ask you also, E.J., about the gang of six - six senators; three Republicans, three Democrats; have been sort of behind the scenes discrete hope of the deficit-cutting camp. They've been adapting ideas from the Bowles-Simpson Commission and elsewhere, it seemed, into some kind of bipartisan plan. Now, Senator Tom Coburn, the conservative Republicans from Oklahoma, says count him out, at least for now. What's going on?"", ""Well, I think it's always been an illusion that if you had all the goodwill in the world in the current climate you could settle this problem. And I think Coburn's withdrawal shows that. You have a fundamental divide in that Republicans are very wary of putting revenue on the table. Yes, the Republicans involved in the gang of six have talked about tax reform but it's not clear how much they're willing to put on the table in new taxes."", ""And if you're not willing to do that, the kind of cuts you have to make to balance the budget are so deep that no Democrats can buy them. Perhaps if this special election on Tuesday in upstate New York, where the Democrat has made a big deal of the Ryan budget - if she wins, the Democrat, a surprise victory, maybe it would shake the debate a little. But I think Coburn was just reflecting a reality."", ""You know, we have to raise taxes, we have to cut Medicare - or at least tax revenues - and this gang of six was the best way to do that. Now, it's hopeless. There's a possibility we'll have a complete meltdown with the debt ceiling this summer."", ""Well, thanks for - also for disabusing our self-illusions left and right here.

Tom, what do we know about the military campaign at this point?"", ""Well, as you say, it started with the French taking on Libyan troops around Benghazi, the last rebel stronghold in the east and it was followed quickly by cruise missiles being fired by warships, British and U.S. warships in the Mediterranean, 110 cruise missiles, each have 1,000-pound warhead, taking out the radar sites, the missiles sites of Moammar Gadhafi so they can implement that no-fly zone. They wouldn't be able to fly safely through Libya without being targeted by these missiles."", 'How could Moammar Gahhafi respond to this? I mean, this is a pretty big campaign now, more than 25 countries involved and presumably will get bigger over the coming days. I mean, how could he respond to these attacks?', ""And two years we had the Lockerbie bombing, which Libyan agents took part in more than - nearly 200 people were killed in that bombing over Scotland. So there's concern particularly about terrorism. Also, he has a good amount of mustard agent, mustard that he could use either against rebels or against civilians. He - western hostages, he could play that card as well. So there were a lot of concerns here about what he could do now that he's cornered."", 'Tom, Defense Secretary Robert Gates was not too keen on imposing a fly zone. Of course you remember just a few weeks ago at a congressional hearing he said, let me be clear, this is a military intervention. It seemed like he was also staking out his position here.', ""Now, Gadhafi isn't overthrown, you could chop the country in half. You get a Benghazi on one side with the rebels, Tripoli with Gadhafi on the other. And then there's going to be a question of what do you do now? Do you arm the rebels? Do you send ground troops in?

But he promised ""we the people"" will meet those challenges. And the cheering throngs who celebrated his inauguration seem ready to try.","[""It's Morning Edition from NPR News. Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. Now that the crowds are gone and the cleanup has begun, a very small number of people woke up this morning with a view of the National Mall. That small number includes the new occupants of the White House. It was a festive Inauguration Day, but a somber speech suggested the challenges of the days ahead. NPR's Scott Horsley reports on a new president's first day."", 'Inauguration Day for Barack Obama began at St. John\'s Episcopal Church not far from the White House. The church choir sang ""This Little Light of Mine,"" and a visiting pastor from Dallas, T.D. Jakes, observed that God always sends the best men into the worst times. Mr. Obama, his running mate, Joe Biden, and their wives then had coffee at the White House with George and Laura Bush and Dick and Lynne Cheney as a huge crowd assembled on the National Mall. The noontime swearing in ceremony was preceded by some all-star musical talent ranging from Itzhak Perlman to Aretha Franklin.', ""(Singing) My country,' tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing..."", 'The day was mostly clear and cold in Washington with temperatures hovering in the 20s. In his inaugural address, President Obama hearkened back to another frigid winter, suggesting that as tough as times might seem right now, the nation has weathered worse.', ""In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by nine campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood..."", 'At that moment, Mr. Obama said, when the American Revolution was most in doubt, George Washington offered an inspirational message.', '""Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it.""', ""Aides say the president's speechwriting team began working on the address before Thanksgiving, but that Mr. Obama himself wrote most of it a couple of weekends ago while holed up in Washington's Hay-Adams Hotel. He wanted to express the severity of the situation the nation finds itself in - a struggling economy and two wars - while at the same time instilling confidence that those challenges can be overcome."", 'Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.', 'The new president has championed a huge economic stimulus package, while at the same time promising to reform health care and develop cleaner forms of energy. He said the question is no longer whether government is too big or too small, but rather whether government works.', ""When the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. When the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government."", 'And as much as government can and should do, Mr. Obama said, every American has to take responsibility for the common good. VIPs at the Capitol included Chesley Sullenberger, the US Airways pilot who guided his crippled jet to a safe river landing last week, then made certain that everyone got off the plane. Mr. Obama paid tribute to some less famous acts of heroism.', ""It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job, which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate."", ""On foreign policy, Mr. Obama renewed his promise to end the war in Iraq, while also warning terrorists that the U.S. won't bend in its battle against them. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered to hear the speech in person in a crowd that stretched from the Capitol well beyond the Washington Monument. Joseph Holloway(ph) and his three-year-old son chose to watch from the far end of the Mall on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial."", ""When you just think about what happened during Lincoln's time and then with King making such a huge statement to the world from these very steps, and to be here when the first African-American president is sworn in to the office is just unbelievable. It's something that, you know, we'll never forget. And I think it's a great opportunity for our son."", 'Mr. Obama did not dwell on race, but he did suggest his election is a sign of how far the nation has come.', 'This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed, why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent Mall, and why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.', ""After taking that oath, with his hand on Lincoln's Bible, Mr. Obama escorted former President Bush to the east side of the Capitol for his departure to his home in Texas. Later, the new White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, issued a memo freezing all pending Bush-era regulations until the new administration can review them. While the new administration has a lot on its plate, the president and first lady did take a few hours yesterday to party."", 'Unidentified Man: Obama, Obama, Obama...', 'The first couple then danced their way through 10 official inaugural balls. It was a long day and a long night, the first of many Mr. Obama will spend as president. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.', 'Let\'s be fair, the presidential oath of office was not as badly botched as the oath in various slapstick movies - you know, where the guy says, repeat after me, I, state your name. And the answer comes back, I, state your name. It wasn\'t that bad. Still there was an awkward moment when Chief Justice John Roberts got the words slightly out of order. He said the word ""faithfully"" in the wrong place. And the new president paused as if wondering whether to say the words in the order that they are written in the Constitution or just politely repeat after Justice Roberts.', 'I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear.', 'I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear.', 'That I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully.', 'That I will execute...', 'The office - faithfully the office of president of the United States.', 'the office of president to the United States faithfully.', 'And will to the best of my ability.', 'And will to the best of my ability.', ""You'll notice that after that awkward pause, the politeness of both men prevailed. Even as the chief justice was correcting himself, the president repeated the words in the way that Roberts misspoke them. Chief Justice Roberts was a nominee of President Bush, and the people that opposed him included Senator Barack Obama, which made that awkward pause, if anything, more meaningful. This first moment of the new administration showcased two people of very different backgrounds and very different views just trying to get it right.

On Monday, President Obama presented his budget for 2012 and early Saturday, the House passed $60 billion in spending cuts. But Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget at the New America Foundation, tells guest host Linda Wertheimer that the budget cuts proposed thus far fail to address the real money-draining federal programs: Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), a member of a bipartisan group of senators considering ways Congress might reach agreement on spending cuts, also offers his insight.","[""It's been a long week of budget debates. The president presented his 2012 budget. He has cuts, but he wants spending on innovation and education."", ""We're going to be making some key investments in places like education and science and technology, research and development, that the American people understand is required to win the future. So what we've done is we've taken a scalpel to the discretionary budget, rather than a machete."", 'That got a mixed reception. In the wee small hours of this morning, the House passed the controversial $60 billion slash on the current budget, as the speaker promised they would.', ""Read my lips: we're going to cut spending."", ""But first, let's take a longer view. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Budget at the New America Foundation, has been following all this closely, so I asked her thoughts on where we're headed."", ""And then, meanwhile, what you're seeing in the House is this movement for some very aggressive cuts on spending concentrated on a very short amount of time, the rest of the fiscal year."", 'Seven months basically.', ""Yeah. And so we're talking about big cuts compared to what we're used to doing in this very small area of the budget as well. It's just about 12 percent of the budget we're focused on when really the biggest parts of the problem are in the rest of the budget - mandatory spending or entitlements - that nobody's talking about."", ""And that, it seems to me, that's the biggest deal, isn't it? That not even the very excited budget cutters in the House have got to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid."", ""That's the elephant in the room. I suppose that the reasons that some of these programs have been growing faster than other parts of the budget and faster than the economy is that they are politically popular."", 'But politically popular would seriously understate it, I think.', ""Likewise, the Republicans, who are allergic to taxes, if they wait too long, which seems to be everybody's favorite political strategy, the problem becomes so large that you end up dropping in a big new tax, like a VAT. So I look at this..."", 'Value-added tax, I should say - national sales tax.', ""As an independent who sees both points of view, I keep thinking, if you both make the changes now, you don't risk the worst scenario that you're both worried about."", 'Now, the president, in talking about what he - the kinds of things he would like to do, he has said it various times that if he comes out for something, if he says something should happen, that it immediately poisons the possibility that it can happen. That, I assume, means that what has to happen is that Republicans who are inclined to reach some sort of agreement and Democrats who are similarly inclined would have to have meetings that would have to be a secret, that would have to be closed. They would have to come out with an agreement.', ""The president does at least have to set the environment where these discussions can take place and they can't be just behind closed doors, because the American public has to be involved as well at some point. But we also have to be straightforward and stop telling voters, hey, we can have tax cuts. We can have spending increases and start preparing expectations that the choices we're going to have to make, they're not easy. They're going to take real shared sacrifice in all parts of the budget."", ""Do you think, looking at the president's budget, are these the budget cuts of a first-term president? Would we see these kinds of cuts if this were his second term?"", ""And so, I also tend to think that the whole notion of we can continue to kick this down past the next election never really works. What we have to do is make - addressing the fiscal problems politically a good thing. And, frankly, I think voters are way ahead of politicians here. I think voters would really appreciate some sort of direct talk about how we're going to fix this problem. So I think it could be turned into a political winner."", 'Thanks very much.', 'Thanks for having me.', 'Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma is part of a bipartisan group of senators considering ways the Congress might reach agreement on paring down deficits and debt into the future.', ""Our historical average interest rate is three times greater than what we're paying right now. And we've seen long-term interest rates starting to creep up in spite of what Chairman Bernanke is doing, in terms of pumping $600 billion into the bond market trying to raise the price of (unintelligible) the interest rates. So we've not gone near far enough."", ""Senator, I think there's sort of general agreement that not enough has been done. But what there is not agreement on is what to do. And let me ask you about the big entitlements. Do you think that Congress is anywhere near contemplating addressing those portions of federal spending or is that just going to have to be left aside?"", ""And to me, if we don't rise up in the next year or two to address this issue, the members of Congress will have the biggest black mark you could imagine in the two or three years that follow, because the economic consequences for our country are going to be disastrous."", 'So, what to do?', ""Well, what to do is it's not hard, is we have to get the fraud out of Medicare, that's 60 to $80 billion a year. We need to drive down health care cost, and you're not going to do that with a centralized government operation on that. Everybody in the country is going to have to sacrifice, and that means the wealthiest and those experiencing the safety net. Everybody's going to get less."", ""Dr. Coburn, you were a member of the president's bipartisan debt commission last year."", 'I was.', 'And your group did try to address the big entitlement programs, the elephants in the room. Are there some big ideas there that you think that Congress should be seriously considering in the current debate?', ""Yeah. They should be considering the Ryan-Rivlin plan, which basically takes care of the poor. But as you come up on your income, if you're very high income, then your benefits decline in terms of Medicare and Social Security. It's a dual track system."", ""Senator, I want to ask you something about - I just want to ask you to think back to when you were first elected. You're a fiscal conservative. You came to Washington convinced that debt and deficit could and should come down. You're a crusader on that issue. You must be remembering those days as you watched the House Republicans, the freshman Republicans in action.

And that means tax cuts for the middle-class. It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs. And then long-term, we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families.

Is it expensive? Yes.', ""Both Obama and McCain had promised to take off the gloves, but the back and forth last night was not nearly as harsh as the candidates' rhetoric on the campaign trail or in their ads.

Still, they managed to clash repeatedly over taxes even when the questions were about something else."", ""You know, nailing down Senator Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall.

I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us. That was Sen. McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment. When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.

And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome. We need fundamental change.

He said, hey, it was an early preview and he said it was kind of a gotcha debate with focus on trivial things. Give a listen to what he says."", 'Forty-five minutes before we heard about health care, 45 minutes before we heard about Iraq, 45 minutes before we heard about jobs, 45 minutes before we heard about gas prices.', ""So that really is, kind of, the focus on it. He was also asked if he will join a debate that has been proposed coming up in advance of the North Carolina primary. And he just laughed, and he said, well, let's just see what the schedule allows. But he says, truth be told, he could recite Senator Clinton's lines, she could recite all of his, and he seemed to be downplaying that possibility."", ""That's NPR's Don Gonyea with the Obama campaign in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thanks so much, Don."", 'My pleasure.', ""NPR's David Greene is with the Clinton campaign in Pennsylvania."", 'Hey, David.', 'Hi, Michele.', 'Where exactly are you right now?', ""We're at Haverford College where Hillary Clinton just wrapped up an event as one of those gorgeous days on a college campus.

What did she have to say?"", 'Well, you know, if you ask the campaign about the debate last night, they talk more about what Senator Obama did, and less about what their own candidate had to say. And they feel like it was a very good night for them.', ""That grilling of Senator Obama on issues such as his former pastor Jeremiah Wright and some other issues. They feel like it sort of broke the aura. It's some wind out of Senator Obama's sails and showed that when he's under tough questioning and he says - and the campaign says that whoever wins the nomination will be under tough questioning in the general election, it shows that he can be rattled a bit."", 'And now these stories have been out there, of course, Michele, and one of the questions the campaign has had to answer is, look, these stories about Reverend Wright and some of the other stories have been out there, and yet Senator Obama continues to pick up all of these superdelegates.', 'So, you know, are these negative stories having a real impact, but before a night that the Clinton campaign says that they feel like it was good for them.', ""So that raised a bit of a question or a dilemma for the Clinton campaign. Recent polls have shown that her efforts to expose Barack Obama's vulnerabilities have also hurt her standing with the public, lowered her likeability ratings. How does the campaign deal with that?"", ""Yeah, and that's the tough situation they're in. And Hillary Clinton was dealing with it a little bit today. This event in Haverford College, a really nice feeling, focusing on the issues, she sat there with her daughter Chelsea Clinton who was sitting in a big cushy chair in front of a lot of the college community."", ""And one person stood up and said, Senator Clinton, if we're out canvassing for you, what should we tell people right now? And she said, well, why don't you tell them I'm really nice? Why don't you tell them that I'm not as bad as you think? So I think they're trying to combat the perception that she really is the nasty side of this race while realizing that being nasty and ripping into Obama a bit is one way that she's going to be able to stay in the game, at least in this campaign's view."", ""And it's good. But before we say goodbye, I assume that she'll be spending most of her time or the next five days in Pennsylvania."", 'Most of the time, it looks like. But one quick stop in North Carolina tomorrow.

I'm Michele Norris."", ""And I'm Robert Siegel."", 'One key issue that defines presidential candidates this year is the war in Iraq.', ""I've been to Iraq three times..."", 'We are succeeding in Iraq.', 'It was the right decision to go Iraq.', 'I was opposed to Iraq from the start.', 'Either they want you U.S. forces to stay in Iraq as long as it takes to win or they want troops out as soon as possible. The rest of the debate is about how and when the candidates reach their conclusions about the war.', 'NPR congressional correspondent David Welna joins me now to talk about the candidates and Iraq. Hello, David.', 'Hello, Robert.', ""And let's start with the Democrats. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, what they want to do in Iraq and how their positions differ."", ""Well, I'd say that both of them want to get out of Iraq as soon as possible. Both of them recognize that the troop escalation that began last year, known as the surge, has brought down violence somewhat in Iraq, but they both say that the surge hasn't brought the political reconciliation, that it was the stated goal."", ""And both of them are saying they have timetables for bringing troops out. Here's Hillary Clinton at the last Democratic candidates' debate last week in Los Angeles."", 'I will begin to withdraw troops in 60 days. I believe that it will take me one to two brigades a month depending how many troops we have there, and that nearly all of them should be out within a year.', ""Well, how much does Senator Clinton's plan for a pullout differ from Senator Obama's plan?"", ""Well, they're essentially the same in their goal of a quick pullout. But while Hillary Clinton says when she'll start bringing troops home, she's refused to give a deadline for bringing them all back. And Obama, on the other hand, has talked about having all combat forces out in 16 months. And both candidates have talked about leaving behind some kind of residual force. But the two of them haven't really clashed over what they'll do in the future. Their fights over Iraq have really been all about the past. Obama never misses a chance to point out that unlike Clinton who voted in the Senate in October of 2002 to authorize the use of force in Iraq. He was opposed to the war from the start."", ""I think I would be the Democrat who would be most effective in going up against a John McCain, or any other Republican, because they all want basically a continuation of George Bush's policies. Because I will offer a pure contrast, somebody who never supported this war, thought it was a bad idea. I don't want to just end the war, but I want to end the mindset that got us into war in the first place. That's the kind of leadership I intend to provide..."", 'Now, Senator Clinton now says that had she known then what she knows now, she would not have voted to authorize the use of force against Iraq. But she has stopped short of apologizing.', ""That's right. And here's how she defended her vote while debating Obama last week in Los Angeles."", 'It was a sincere vote, based on my assessment at the time, and what I believed he would do with the authority he was given. He abused that authority. He misused that authority. I warned at the time it was not authority for preemptive war. Nevertheless, he went ahead and raged one which has led to the position we find ourselves in today.', ""And here's what Obama had to say about that."", 'The authorization had the title: an authorization to use military force - U.S. military force - in Iraq. I think everybody the day after the vote was taken understood this was a vote potentially to go to war. I think people were very clear about that. That...', 'An interesting footnote to this, by the way, when the New York Times endorsed Senator Clinton, they pointed out that they urged her to vote against the authorization to go to war in Iraq. And that was their editorial position, but forgave her on that in light of other things.', ""On to the Republicans. John McCain said that U.S. forces should stay in Iraq as long as they are needed, whether that's a hundred years more or a thousand years more."", 'Yeah. I think McCain rues the day the U.S. gave up on Vietnam where he spent 5 years as a prisoner of war. And for him, Iraq has become a test of American resolve and credibility. He argues that what Americans can\'t stand about having troops deployed abroad isn\'t that the they\'re there, but that that they\'re dying there. And here\'s McCain yesterday on ""Fox News Sunday.""', ""Look, we're in Kuwait next to the war to Iraq. We're in Turkey. We're in Bosnia. We're all over the world. One of the obligations, unfortunately, of being a great superpower is that we have to take care of the world security. But we don't have to have casualties because we can succeed in the strategy called the surge which is now, I think, experiencing significant success."", 'And Senator McCain accuses his rival for the Republican nomination, Mitt Romney, of having talked about the secret timetables last year.', ""That's right, Robert. This is what he said at the Los Angeles debate."", 'The first word was timetables, timetables. Governor, the right answer to that question was no, not what you said. And that was we looked - we don\'t want to have to lay - have them lay in the weeds until we leave, and Maliki and the president should enter into some kind of agreement for, quote, ""timetables.""', 'Well, here\'s what Romney actually told ABC\'s ""Good Morning America"" in an interview in early April that McCain was referring to.', 'Do you believe that there should be a timetable in withdrawing the troops?', ""Well, there's no question, but that the president and Prime Minister al-Maliki have to have a series of timetables and milestones that they speak about. But those shouldn't be for public pronouncement. You don't want the enemy to understand how long they have wait in the weeds until you're going to be gone."", 'So Romney actually seemed to want to attach some privately agreed upon conditions that triggers to any withdrawal.', ""Right. In contrast to simply wanting a secret deal for a pullout as McCain accused him of saying. Romney now says, like McCain, that the U.S. should stay in Iraq as long as needed to achieve victory there. And he also says he wants another 100,000 troops added to the U.S. military, and he's proposing better benefits as a way to attract and retain them."", ""We found in our state that we were losing enrollees for the National Guard at about 6 percent per year. And the legislature and I got together and passed something called The Welcome Home Bill. We said, you know what, if you'll sign up for the National Guard, we'll pay for entire education for four years. We'll put in some other benefits as well - life insurance and other features that we decide to pay for. And the result of that was, the next year, enrollments went up 30 percent. And so, if you want more people to sign up for the military, we have to improve the deal."", 'Now, the other major Republican contender, Mike Huckabee, is also setting no timetable for withdrawing.', ""However long it takes to get of there with victory and with honor.

NPR-45530,Talk of the Nation,2010-02-25,https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124082711,Parsing Points Made At Health Care Summit,"Scott Horsley, White House correspondent for NPR
Julie Rovner, health policy correspondent, NPR President Obama made his case for a health care bill to a small group of Republicans and Democrats Thursday, on live television. The meeting convened in the same week the president unveiled his own draft of a health care bill, the third attempt at crafting legislation.","[""This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington."", 'health care.', 'Both the House and Senate have passed different versions of a bill, but no Republicans voted in favor, and they take recent election results as public support for their demand to scrap the Democratic bills and start from scratch.', 'On Monday, President Obama implicitly rejected that when he released his own draft, a blend of the House and Senate bills, but also said that he would be open to Republican proposals.', 'As one of 40 men and women seated around a rectangular table at Blair House this morning, President Obama pleaded for a substantial discussion, not what he called political theater.', 'We all know this is urgent. And unfortunately, over the course of the year, despite all the hearings that took place and all the negotiations that took place and people on both sides of the aisle worked long and hard on this issue, and you know, this became a very ideological battle. It became a very partisan battle, and politics, I think, ended up trumping practical common sense.', 'The first response came from Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who said there could be no progress unless Democrats agree to abandon any recourse to a procedure called reconciliation, which would allow them to pass most of the bill through the Senate on a simple majority vote, not the 60 votes needed to break a minority filibuster.', ""You and I and many other senators worked together on the America Competes Act. We know how to do that. We can do that on health care, as well. But to do that, we'll have to renounce jamming it through in a partisan way, and if we don't, then the rest of what we do today will not be relevant."", ""I mean, the only thing bipartisan will be the opposition to the bill. And we'll be saying to the American people, who have tried to tell us in every way they know how - town halls and elections and surveys - that they don't want this bill, that they would like for us to start over."", 'So if we can do that, start over, we can write a health care bill. It means putting aside jamming it through, it means working together the way General Marshall and Senator Vandenberg did. It means reducing health care costs and making that our goal for now and not focusing on the other goals. And it means going step by step together to re-earn the trust of the American people.', ""Republican Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Later in the program, we'll continue our look at this year's Oscar-nominated documentaries, but first, the health care summit."", 'Joining me in the studio are NPR health policy correspondent Julie Rovner and NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Have you been watching? If so, what have you learned? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org.', 'And, well, Julie Rovner, let me begin with you. On the way in, both sides seemed to be downplaying the prospects of any breakthroughs or agreements of magnitude here. Is this living down to expectations?', ""Very much so, I'm afraid. You know, even if you're a policy wonk like I am, this is not very scintillating stuff. I think I teased on my Twitter feed going into the lunch break that I was wondering if there was some Olympic curling on this afternoon."", ""This is really - there's a reason why - somebody said this was like watching a, you know, a congressional conference committee being televised. And I said, no, it's not like watching a congressional conference committee being televised. At a congressional conference committee, which is when two committees get together to actually write a bill, they do work. This really is just talking points."", ""These are the same talking points that we have heard over and over and over again. And of course, the president has tried several times to interrupt that, to say let's get beyond some of the talking points, find places of agreement. But really, you know, the Democrats came in to say we want to go ahead and do this, and the Republicans came in and said we don't like your bill, we want you to start over. And that's what we heard several hours of, basically."", ""And Scott Horsley, the president said at one point, you know, I'm not sure that these gaps can be bridged. If not, at least we'll have better clarified our disagreements. Is this really sort of a last-ditch attempt to say: Here's our position, here's your position, if you guys won't come to us, we're going to go it alone?"", ""I think that's exactly right, and I think that's the White House goal here, is if they do proceed down the path of reconciliation and to pass this without Republican support, they want to be on record and on television as having given the Republicans an opportunity to make their case."", 'The Republicans included, well, several of their doctors that they have in the House of Representatives and the United States Senate, among them Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, a senator and a medical doctor, an OB/GYN, who complained that Congress is practicing bad medicine.', 'The first thing I would do is put out a caution to us because what I see the Congress doing, and what I saw this last year, is us actually performing bad medicine, and that is that we get stuck in the idea of treating the symptom rather than treating the disease.', ""And whether you go to Harvard or whether you go to Thomson Reuters, there's some facts we know about health care in America. And the facts we know is one out of every three dollars that gets spent doesn't help anybody get well and doesn't prevent anybody from getting sick."", 'The second thing we know is, from the Congressional Research Service, that most of the mal-drivers(ph) today in health care come from government rules and regulations.', ""The government now directs over 60 percent of the health care in this country. And if throwing money at it and creating new government programs could solve it, we wouldn't be sitting here today because we've done all that. It hasn't worked."", 'So what I thought we ought to do is maybe talk about, why does it cost so much? Because the thing that keeps people from getting access to care in our country is cost.', ""You mentioned Malia and Sasha. The fact is, is with young kids going to the ER whether they have meningitis or asthma, they're going to get treated in this country, but they may get labeled with a pre-existing illness after that. And that's another thing I'll be happy to talk about at a later time. But the fact is, is we know how to treat acute asthma. What we don't do a good job of it preventing children from getting acute asthma."", ""And I'm corrected. Dr. Coburn, Dr. Senator Coburn, is a primary care physician, though he does deliver a lot of babies. And Julie Rovner, much of the morning session taken up on this question of containing costs and which party's ideas would do that more effectively than the other."", 'Absolutely, and this is - and a lot of throwing around of facts that were sort of taken selectively, if you will, from the various estimates made by the Congressional Budget Office, one of the big ones talking about, you know, whose plan would raise premiums and whose plan would lower premiums.', 'And indeed, there seem to be - at some point, everybody conceded, well, fundamental, philosophical differences on this point.', ""Oh yes, very much so, and I think that's, you know, the biggest problem. There are a lot of things that Democrats and Republicans do agree on going forward, but the bottom line is they disagree on the role of government, and that's the hardest part of this."", ""The Democrats think government has a fairly large role to play in the health care system, and the Republicans don't."", ""Well, let's see if we can get some callers in on the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. Jay's(ph) calling us from Durham, North Carolina."", ""Yeah, hi. My question was: Do you think that this is a culmination of Obama's game plan or strategy, that he gave Congress the chance? He lost popularity, I think, because he did that, and now that he's going to take the reins and push it through."", ""Well, let's put that Scott Horsley, and again, this is informed by the Clinton administration's experience with health care, when the task force headed by Hillary Clinton came out with their proposal, and Congress proceeded to pick it to death, and then it went nowhere. This time around, the president said: Congress, you take the lead. House of the Representatives, the United States Senate, you write the bill."", ""That's right, and I don't think this is so much the culmination of the president's strategy as what he's sort of been forced to do as the - leaving it up to the legislature has not worked for him. So it sort of, as a desperation move, he has now said okay, I will step in, I will put my stamp on that, something he has tried very hard not to do, not only with health care but with other bills moving through Congress throughout the last year."", ""So he's trying to say all right, if this is where we are, this is the last chance."", 'Yes.', ""Julie Rovner, this blend of President Obama's, of the House and Senate packages, is this pretty much the Democratic bill?"", 'Well, yeah, this is where that bill was going anyway. Remember, this is - essentially a lot of the things in this proposal are things that the Democratic leadership in the House and Senate had either already agreed to or were on their way to agreeing to. The problem with this bill, of course, is that in order to get this through, even if they use the reconciliation, the budget reconciliation process, the House will probably have to pass the Senate bill first.', ""There's a lot of distrust right now between the House and the Senate. I'm just talking about Democrats. I'm not even talking about Republicans. Pretty much in order to use the budget reconciliation process, the House is going to have to pass the Senate-passed bill, and they're still not really there yet. So..."", ""Jay, I wonder if you're still listening with us in Durham?"", 'Yes, I am.', 'Have you been watching this?', ""Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've been following the whole - I didn't see today's summit, but I've followed the whole debate, and I couldn't reconcile in my mind how someone as smart as Obama would allow the Congress to take over in the fights, and he just lost control, it seemed like. But I'm just wondering if maybe he's just slyer than we all..."", ""I'm sure he would like to think so. Well, maybe not. I don't know about that. Well, President Obama, Scott Horsley, kept setting deadlines. He wanted both houses to pass a bill by the end of August, before Labor Day, before the Labor Day break. These deadlines kept slipping and slipping and slipping. A lot of political prognosticators said wait a minute, if this goes on too long, past the first of the year, then you're in an election year, and who knows what can happen then."", 'He gave Congress an enormous amount of rope, and they tried to hang themselves with it and him as well.', ""And indeed, after the first of the year, the most unlikely thing happened. Ted Kennedy's seat in Massachusetts came open. There was a special election for it, and much to the Democrats' surprise and chagrin, Scott Brown, a Republican, was elected, and there goes your 60- seat majority."", ""And Julie was talking about the negotiations that have been going on with the House and Senate leadership. I mean, the week before the Tuesday election when the Democrats lost their majority, the president was up until 1 o'clock in the morning, sitting there with House and Senate negotiators, trying to hammer out a compromise, all for naught the following Tuesday, when they lost their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate."", 'Julie Rovner?', ""But, you know, it's important to remember he's the president and not the prime minister. I mean, we do not have, you know, a parliamentary system. The president - and boy is he discovering this the hard way - does not control the Congress. The Congress controls the Congress. And you know, he can beg, he can cajole, he can lead, but he can't make the Congress do what the Congress isn't ready to do."", ""And we're getting sort of a parliamentary glimpse today, when we actually do have the president sitting down with the lawmakers. This was sort of modeled on what he did with the House Republican caucus a few weeks ago, which the White House thought worked very well for him. He looked good in that setting, and so they've decided to try it again."", ""Interesting. In that setting, he was sort of, though, at a podium, set apart. Here, he's at a table, one of 40, and well, he's presiding - then again he is the president. Nevertheless, one of 40 people, though he gets the microphone, I noticed, whenever he asks for it."", ""We're going to continue with Julie Rovner and with Scott Horsley and more of your calls, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. The health care summit continues. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."", ""This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. A remarkable, made-for-TV political event today. President Obama, Vice President Biden, select members of both parties from the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate continue to meet at Blair House, across the street from the White House, to try to compromise on a health care bill or make political points, depending on your point of view."", 'Some 40 lawmakers seated in a square just across from the White House. Despite the high profile of the summit, expectations are low. Few, if any, expect a major agreement on much of anything by the end of the day.', ""The event is going on live. President Obama is speaking. Let's listen in."", ""...very useful tool for the vast majority of people who've got pre-existing conditions. Just because there's just not enough money that you guys put into it to be able to cover all the people with pre-existing conditions, which is why other states have high-risk pools, Kathleen mentioned."", ""There are I don't know how many states, but let's say 20, 21 states currently have high-risk pools. Out of all those 21 states, about 200,000 people use the high-risk pool. And the reason is because by just dealing with older, less healthy individuals separately or people with pre-existing conditions, it is very, very expensive."", ""Tom's point was if everybody's in it because presumably none of us know at any given moment who's going to end up being healthy and who's not, we don't know whether our kids are going to be suffering some sort of disease that we don't anticipate yet, or, you know, our spouses get ill, that if everybody's in it, then that drives prices down cheaper for everybody."", ""So it's not that I think that the high-risk pool idea is a bad one. As I said, the House, the Senate bill, the bill - the proposal that I put forward, all use the high-risk pool as a stopgap measure to get to a broader pool, but the goal has to be to get everybody in in a place where those risks are spread more broadly."", 'And if I just might say, we support high-risk pools and reinsurance with $25 billion in funding. The House and Senate versions are $5 billion in funding, and because of that robust support, CBO says this will work.', ""The fundamental difference after that is that the Health and Human Services secretary, in that four-year period when they're somewhat similar, has the authority to raise the premiums. All of that is brought to Washington."", 'We leave that authority in the states so that they can manage their state pools. And then after the bill becomes effective in 2014, the real problem becomes this - the mandate and the costs, the forcing of the purchase of insurance, which many Americans find objectionable, and that - you can avoid that mandate if you continue to design this as we do in the beginning.', ""And that second voice there, Dave Camp, a Republican congressman from Michigan, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. And Julie Rovner, let's get a little translation of what they were talking about: the high-risk pools, we're talking about pre-existing conditions here?"", ""That's right. This was something that Senator McCain, in fact, when he was running for president last year proposed. This was one of the centerpieces of his health care proposal. Indeed as Congressman Camp was mentioning, many states have these. They actually don't work so well. As the president pointed out, only about 200,000 people who have pre-existing conditions are enrolled in them. That's because they are very, very expensive, and a lot of them actually have waiting periods of their own."", ""So if you get diagnosed with cancer, you won't be able to buy insurance, and they'll say you're eligible for the state's high-risk pool, but then they may say you have to wait a year. So obviously, if you have cancer, it's a problem to then wait a year to get covered in the state's high- risk pool. And once you get in, the premiums, because they are only for people who are very sick, even though they are subsidized by the states, they're actually usually subsidized by the insurance companies. A portion of premiums that are paid go to help fund the high-risk pools. But the premiums are still very, very high, again because they're - they tend to be underfunded."", 'So the idea here is that while it will take several years before this bill, assuming it was passed, were to take effect, they would have high- risk pools for people with pre-existing conditions in the interim, and there would be a considerably larger amount of money to help fund them.', 'The Democratic plan is to use the high-risk pool as a means to get from here to there, until the ban on insurance companies using pre- existing conditions to exclude people...', 'Kicks in in 2014.', 'For the Republicans, this is the plan. This is what you would have forever.', ""In perpetuity. And when we hear a Republican like Dave Camp say mandates, he's saying Washington will require you to buy insurance."", ""This is the quandary because there's an agreement on both sides of the aisle that you don't want to have people excluded from having insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. But if you tell insurance companies you have to cover everybody, then people would naturally not buy insurance until they got sick, and of course, that would defeat the purpose."", 'So the Democratic answer to that is, well, so you have a mandate. You require everyone to get insurance.', 'Everybody buys insurance.', ""And you subsidize those who couldn't afford it on their own."", ""And then you get into escalating cost, which is, well, there's another part of the controversy that we're talking today and the fundamental differences, which are apparently not being bridged as we listen."", ""Barbara's(ph) on the line, calling from Greenwich, Connecticut."", ""Hi, yes. I actually can hear the president coming through with some facts and not just talking points and actually calling out when various members are only doing talking points and really finding places where there are - there is agreement, and that things can go forward. I just wonder if the media will ever acknowledge that there actually are some facts coming forward here, and it isn't just a fait accompli."", 'Julie Rovner?', 'Well, the president is trying, I will say. His goal is to try to find places where there are areas of agreement. And indeed, I think in the proposal the president put forward on Monday, he - you know, there was a whole sheet that they put out. You know, here are all the places that Republicans had proposed ideas that we have put into this bill.', ""But as I mentioned a few minutes ago, the fundamental problem is that there's a - such a big difference in philosophy between what the Democrats want and what the Republicans want when it comes to the role of government. That even if you take a lot of these Republican ideas and put them in the bill, if the bill is so heavily weighted towards a big government role in health care, the Republicans still aren't going to want to vote for the bill, even if you take all their ideas and put it in them. If it's overlaid with all this government, it's still not going to be a bill that the Republicans are going to be able to support."", ""If we're talking about the Republicans in Congress in 2010."", ""That's right."", ""I mean, this is - the Democratic plan is very similar to the plan that the Republican governor, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, endorsed. It's similar to a plan that Republicans like Chuck Grassley had endorsed years ago, but where the Republican Party in Congress is today, this is a bridge too far."", ""In fact, the individual mandate that they're talking about now was originally - was dreamed up by Republicans for Republicans back in the early 1990s to counter - originally it was to counter the employer mandate that was being pushed in the 1988 election but also then to - was introduced in Congress to counter the Clinton plan."", ""And Barbara, your point on, well, chiding Republicans about talking points, let's listen to an exchange he has, the president has here, with Eric Cantor, a Republican of Virginia, the deputy whip, I think, from the House of Representatives. And he - as Representative Cantor begins to speak, there's a huge stack of documents in front of him."", ""Mr. President, thank you again very much for having us and for staying with us for the six hours, appreciate that. I don't know if you will after the six hours or not, but..."", ""I gather - let me just guess. That's the 2,400-page health care bill. Is that right?"", 'Well, actually, Mr. President, this is the Senate bill, along with the...', 'Okay.', ""...11-page proposal that you put up online that really I think is the basis for the discussion here. So - but I do want to go back to your suggestion as to why we're here, and you suggested that maybe we are here to find some points of agreement, to bridge the gap in our differences."", ""And I do like to go back to basics. We're here because we Republicans care about health care, just as the Democrats in this room. And when the speaker cites her letters from the folks in Michigan, and the leader talks about the letters he's received, Mr. Andrews(ph) his, all of us share the concerns when people are allegedly wronged in our health care system. I mean, I think that is sort of a given."", ""And Mr. Cantor there, the congressman from Virginia, Julie, making the point that yes, all right, maybe I'm using a political prop with this stack of documents and showing how big the bill is. Democrats keep reading letters from constituents saying how wronged they have been, pulling at the emotional heartstrings, and that's political theater, too."", ""That's right, it is. And that's back to the point that I was making originally, that this is definitely a made-for-TV event. This is not - it's very difficult. This goes back, I think the origin of - part of the origin of today's event is that the president perhaps not very helpfully promised that the negotiations - when he was on the campaign trail, promised that all negotiations on the health bill would be televised on C-SPAN."", ""So here we are with this being televised on C-SPAN. But it's very hard to do serious negotiations on C-SPAN because you end up with a lot of, you know, playing to the cameras, and today is an awful lot of playing to the cameras."", 'It was a point that Senator John McCain, his opponent in the last election, John McCain of course Republican of Arizona, made in his remarks when he addressed the health care summit earlier this morning, and this is what President Obama had to say in response.', ""Let me just make this point, John, because we're not campaigning anymore. The election's over. The..."", ""I'm reminded of that every day."", ""...well, I - yeah. So the - we can spend the remainder of the time with our respective talking points going back and forth. We were supposed to be talking about insurance. You know, obviously, I'm sure that Harry Reid and Chris Dodd and others who went through an exhaustive process through the both the House and the Senate with the most hearings, the most debates on the floor, the longest markup in 22 years on each and every one these bills, would have a response for you."", ""My concern is is that if we do that, then we're essentially back on Fox News or MSNBC on the split screen just arguing back and forth. So my hope would be that we can just focus on the issues of how we actually get a bill done. And this is probably a good time to turn it over to Secretary Sebelius, who..."", 'Could I just say, Mr. President, the American people care about what we did and how we did it.', 'Well, they absolutely...', ""And I think we ought - and that's a subject that I think we should discuss now. Thank you."", ""They absolutely do care about it, John. And I think that the way you characterized it, obviously, would get some strong objections from the other side. We can have a debate about process, or we can have a debate about how we're actually going to help the American people at this point."", 'And Scott Horsley, when Senator McCain referred to process, he was talking about the special deal for Florida, the special deal for Louisiana, the special deal for Nebraska, which was in, and then out. But, anyway, he said this is terribly unseemly. We need to go back and start - and special interest deals, as well - start from scratch and treat everybody equally.', ""And I think it is unseemly, and it is a big part of what the American people turned against as this process dragged on and on. And I - more so than Eric Cantor, more so than Senator Alexander, I think John McCain got under the president's skin a little bit. You heard a little bit of testiness from President Obama there. And I think the - I think he feels uncomfortable having to defend the process, which, I'm sure, he doesn't like any better than anyone else does."", ""We're talking with Scott Horsley, NPR White House correspondent, and with Julie Rovner, our health policy correspondent about the health care summit that's underway at Blair House across the street from the White House. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."", ""And let's go next to Martine(ph), Martine with us from Portland."", ""Yeah, hi. I guess my point that - is that - as I told your screener, I'm married to a Republican. I'm a Democrat. I would say we're both moderates."", ""Do your dinner conversations sound like what we've been hearing all day at Blair House?"", 'Well, my husband - when we start to talk politics, you know, we definitely try to avoid certain things. But...', 'Like foreign and domestic policy.', ""Exactly. You've got it. But one thing, I think, you know, as I'm hearing this, and one conversation that we have had is that, you know, I'm from Oregon. It's a fairly liberal state. But my husband, being a moderate Republican, we have friends that are moderate Republicans. We all want something to happen. We all need the process to move forward. And I always say to my husband, you know, if you're - if you don't feel your voice was being heard as a Republican, you should stand up and say that."", ""It's like where is the Republican Party as far as the moderate Republican? I know they want a change, you know? It happens in every - many other countries. There's successful health care, you know, without screaming socialism. It can be done, you know? And I, as far as being Democrat, have been frustrated with my own party for not, you know, getting on message and getting it aligned. I mean..."", ""Mm-hmm. Well, let's see if we can get a response to that from Julie Rovner. If the political risk to the president is - well, the American people seem to be opposed to this kind of legislation, and the process that Scott Horsley was talking about just a moment ago, the danger for the Republicans is they're seen as the party of, well, we just want to kill health care and, no, we don't care about a bill."", ""You know, there's a lot of different sort of factions. You know, if you just look at it as the Democrats versus the Republicans, that really is not a good snapshot. You've got liberals who are furious that their - you know, for - not just the people who support single-payer, who have been furious for a year..."", ""They're outside demonstrating."", ""Yeah. That's right. The people who want a public option, that's not on the table anymore. Then within the Republican Party, you've got - as this caller points out - a lot of Republican moderates who would really like to do something. Remember, this bill looks an awful lot like the Republican moderate bill from 1993, of which there are four senators still in Congress who supported that bill: Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch, Kit Bond, Bob Bennett - so four Republican senators who were cosponsors of the bill that looks an awful lot like this who are now are saying they don't want any part of it. Olympia Snowe, who - from Maine, who voted for the bill in the Finance Committee, but now has - at first she said, well, she wanted more time. But she's obviously had a considerable amount of time and..."", 'And time to see the results for Massachusetts, perhaps.', ""Yeah. So - yeah. There's a lot of - there's some moderate Republicans still around. And Susan Collins, who - also from Maine who does often what Olympia Snowe does. So it's hard to know where the, sort of, moderate Republicans are on this."", ""Well, let's - we just have a couple of minutes left. And let's see where we think it's going to go if we don't emerge with any grand agreement at the end of the day from Blair House. Scott Horsley, the president says he wants a bill by the end of March. Is this - it's an active prospect at this point?"", ""It is. It's certainly a possibility that they could force this through, through reconciliation. You know, that - we've got these conflicting polls where people don't like this bill, but they don't want Congress to give up. And I guess they're maybe hoping that they would do something like the Republicans are suggesting, which is start over. Well, that's not going to happen. So it's either going to be this bill, or they give up. And that's going to be a choice."", 'And Julie, is there a prospect - not just the political prospect of getting it through the Senate, through that very controversial reconciliation procedure if they have to do that, and that limits the kind of bill they can have. But nevertheless, are there votes for this kind of a bill in the House of Representatives?', ""Well, I think, they're going to, you know, have to be cajoled. But the other interesting thing about the polls is, yes, if you look at the polls, they don't like this bill. But if you then poll on the individual elements that are in the bill, the public likes those it very much."", 'So the Republicans have done a really good job at pillaring the bill. But the things that make up the bill still remain very popular.', ""Julie Rovner, NPR health policy correspondent, we're going to let you get back to looking for women's curling on TV. And our White House correspondent..."", 'Or men.', ""Or men's, anyway you go. And Scott, our White House correspondent, Scott Horsley, here with us in Studio 3A. Thank you both very much. And, well, I expect we're going to be back on this before the next six weeks are out.

NPR-45698,Talk of the Nation,2010-02-09,https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123532509,"Understanding Iran, 31 Years After Revolution","Feb. 11 marks the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. NPR's Mike Shuster and former Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns look back at the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, assess Iran's nuclear ambitions today, and weigh the Obama administration's options for responding.","[""This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington."", ""There's a sense that all sides in Iran are holding their breath as they look ahead to the day after tomorrow. That's the anniversary of the Islamic revolution and a day when protestors and government supporters are expected in the streets."", 'Both have staged enormous marches in recent months but never on the same day. At the same time, Iran provided fresh evidence of its determination to press ahead with its nuclear ambitions in defiance of United Nations resolutions.', ""We'll get the latest from NPR's Mike Shuster in Dubai and talk with former Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns about the options on Iran. If you'd like to join the conversation, our phone number is 800-989- 8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our Web site. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION."", 'Later in the program, Jason Beaubien was one of the first NPR reporters to reach Port-au-Prince after the earthquake four weeks ago today. He joins us to take your calls.', 'But first, NPR foreign correspondent Mike Shuster is following events in Iran and joins us by phone. Mike, also nice to have you on with us.', 'Thanks, Neal. Good to be with you.', ""And you're in Dubai, on the opposite shore of the Persian Gulf because?"", ""Yes, I'm about as close as you can get to Iran without actually being in Iran, and of course, the mood, at least the government's mood, toward foreign correspondents hasn't been good since last June."", ""And I wonder, is there any way to anticipate what might happen on Thursday, when people mark the revolution's anniversary?"", ""Well, I think that there is a way of anticipating. We won't know for sure, but since last June 12, when the election brought a second term for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took place, there have been so many demonstrations, and they've been on politically and religiously sensitive dates. And the opposition has continued to bring out large numbers of people in the streets, and in late December, for instance, there was a demonstration that actually turned quite violent, and there were eight or nine people killed by gunshots coming from the security forces."", ""So we can - it looks like both the government and the opposition is anticipating something like that only bigger. The leaders of the opposition have repeatedly called on protestors to come out into the streets, and the government has constantly been warning protestors that there could be very serious violence if they do come out in the streets. That's a recipe for confrontation."", ""There's also been the - well, sober lesson, if you will, some protestors, some people involved in previous protests, have been executed."", ""Yes, there were two a couple of weeks ago who were hanged, and the government threatened, before Thursday, to hang several more. There are a lot of people who have been arrested and freshly put in jail, including some journalists. The government, so far, hasn't carried out the threat to execute more associated with the protests, but we still have a couple of days to go before Thursday."", ""It clearly was a signal to the opposition that they face violence and potential death if protestors continue to go out into the streets, but I've been amazed constantly at the bravery and determination of those in the opposition to go out in the streets and largely protest nonviolently."", ""The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the anniversary punch, quote-unquote, at least that's the translation we got, will stun the West. Any idea what that punch might be?"", ""No, I think that's a threat. He's talked about that before. Other key leaders, particularly of the revolutionary guards and the police, have made similar statements. Clearly they don't want demonstrators to come out into the streets, and I think that's especially true on February 11 because February 11th was the anniversary of the triumph of the Islamic revolution 31 years ago."", ""It's like the - July 4 for Americans, and this is a time when the opposition is calling on tens of thousands of people to come out into the streets and effectively, not overtly, but effectively pose a challenge to the government on its most emotive political holiday. So it makes sense that the government - from their point of view, the government leaders want to prevent that from occurring."", 'And how profound is this challenge? Is there any idea, at this moment, how many people the opposition can count on?', ""No, I don't think we can really know. The largest demonstration that took place after the election last June was on June 15th, three days after the election, and there were millions of people in the streets then. The opposition has not been able to recapitulate that at any time since, but thousands of people have certainly come out into the streets for demonstrations since that time and probably tens of thousands at the end of December."", ""So we know that under the best of circumstances for protestors, if they weren't facing the guns and the truncheons of the security forces that there would be many, many people who go out into the streets. What's amazing to me is that in the face of violence, so many people continue to do that."", 'Then there is the other set of developments, and that revolves around a nuclear program of Iran. Last week, briefly, there was excitement after President Ahmadinejad told a television interview that Iran was ready to accept the U.N. deal and send its low-enriched uranium out of the country to be reprocessed up to 20 percent for use in a medical reactor to provide isotopes for medicines, and then apparently, that was all described as a misunderstanding.', ""It's very hard to understand the Iranian strategy on this because they've been back and forth on this for quite some time. Just a couple of weeks ago, it seemed that that deal, which was originally proposed by the United States to Iran last fall, it seemed that that deal was dead."", ""The Obama administration had given Iran, you'll remember, a loose deadline of the end of 2009. That carried over into January, but finally in late January, it seemed to be clear from statements by the Iranian government that there was no deal, no swap, it wasn't going to take place."", ""And then just a few days ago, you get President Ahmadinejad saying oh no, we'll take that deal, and then that was withdrawn on Sunday, in effect when Ahmadinejad said he had given instructions to Iran's atomic energy organization to go ahead and start increasing the grade of enriched uranium on their own, and that's what they claim they started to do today."", ""So it's been a very confusing time, and the world has been really watching this quite closely. I mean, one thing the Iranians did do is up the interest all over the world, in what, precisely, they are actually doing with their uranium. It feels to me like it's impossible at this point to keep whatever they're going to do a secret."", ""The secretary of defense and the president of the United States continue to talk about the prospects of, well, given their unwillingness to take the deal, now is the time for sanctions, and this latest announcement that they're going to go reprocess this uranium up to 20 percent on their own, the Russians, who've been reluctant to go along with the prospect of sanctions, describe this is a blatant violence of U.N. Security Council resolutions."", 'Well, it does seem that the Russians, for the first time, have really taken note of this and are somewhat alarmed at the Iranian steps. The Russians, to some degree, have been a buffer between the United States and the Europeans on the one hand and the Iranians on the other, and the Russians have said well, up until today, the Russians have said no need for new sanctions, this can be worked out.', ""That's the Chinese position, as well. But this action that Iran took today or at least announced it was going to take seems to have gotten the attention quite robustly of the Russians, and yeah, we're hearing much tougher comments come out from members of the Obama administration, especially Secretary of Defense Gates, who is on a tour in Europe and who had some tough things to say about sanctions in Iran in both Italy and France. And you know, Neal, I think that that probably is the reason why there were demonstrations today at the Italian embassy and the French embassy in Tehran."", ""There were small groups of pro-government demonstrators that marched to both embassies and threw rocks and eggs at the embassies. And I'm guessing that the reason is because the leaders of both Italy and France appeared with Gates over the last couple of days and appeared to be with him in calling for additional sanctions against Iran."", 'The security council could not impose sanctions without the vote of or at least the...', 'At least the acquiescence...', 'Acquiescence of China, yes, exactly. Has there been shift thus far or any statement from Beijing?', ""A couple of days ago, a Chinese diplomat did say, I think at the foreign ministry in Beijing, that this wasn't the time for sanctions, it wasn't necessary at this point."", ""The Chinese tend to follow the lead of the Russians in this. The Russians to some degree provide cover for China in some of these issues. But we'll have to see, once it actually gets into the Security Council for further discussions, because the truth is that Iran going ahead and doing this raises a number of red flags, but it also, it can be argued that as a result of further enrichment of uranium, Iran may be violating U.N. Security Council resolutions that are already in the books and they have already imposed three rounds of sanctions on them. So this is a serious - it'll become a serious matter for the Security Council whatever the different nations of the - whatever position they take."", ""And what of Iran's neighbors? You're there in the Persian Gulf."", ""I think there's a lot of nervousness, and there has been for quite some time, particularly among the Gulf Arab states, Saudi Arabia and the smaller states."", ""They see Iran growing as a regional power. I think that that's acknowledged that Iran is a regional power. But they always get nervous when there seems to be moments when there's a greater tension between Iran and the United States because they fear that they could be caught in the middle of any kind of shooting war if it were to break out."", ""And so the Saudis tend to take a firm stance against Iran, and the smaller Gulf states, because there's a lot of banking that's done through here, Dubai for instance, and a lot of trade that's done with Iran through Dubai, they don't want to see anything like a serious conflict break out."", ""And the neighbors, of course, are concerned not just about developments inside Iran, but what's going inside Iraq as that plays out, vis-Ã -vis Iran; and what plays out in Afghanistan, as that goes, vis-Ã -vis Iran. The United States is so heavily involved in this part of the world."", 'Well, that just underscores how much of a regional player Iran is. Iran has a significant role to play in Iraq, and it has close relations with a number of Shiite parties and politicians in Iraq, and Iran has had much to do with the conflict in Afghanistan over a long period of time.', 'And in fact, the Iranians have overtly said that were the United States so take any kind of serious military action against Iran that it could retaliate against the United States in both those countries, in Iraq and Iran.', ""So there's a real feeling not that conflict necessarily will break out anytime soon, but if there were to be some kind of conflict, it would quickly spread in the region."", ""Mike Shuster, thanks very much. He's there in Dubai for National Public Radio News, watching the situation in Iran. Appreciate it, Mike."", ""You're welcome."", ""Coming up, we'll be talking with Nicholas Burns, undersecretary of state for political affairs in the George W. Bush administration. He'll tell us what he thinks some of the options are at this point, where we go from here, and your calls, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. Stay with us. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."", ""This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington."", ""President Obama made a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing within this past hour. One of the issues he addressed: Iran's nuclear ambitions. He said the U.S. is developing what he called a significant regime of sanctions in response to Iran's continued steps toward what he called nuclear weaponization."", 'The president also mentioned that he has concerns over who exactly speaks for the government in Tehran.', ""One of the difficulties in dealing with Iran over the last several months is it's not always clear who's speaking on behalf of the government, and we get a lot of different mixed signals."", ""But what's clear is, is that they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia, China, Germany, France, Great Britain and the United States all said was a good deal and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do and that Iran should accept."", 'President Obama, speaking at the White House Briefing Room within the last few minutes. This week, Iranians marked the 31st anniversary of the Islamic revolution and continue to debate its legacy, while at the same time Tehran announces it intends to further enrich uranium, in apparent defiance of U.N. resolutions.', ""And let's go now to Nicholas Burns, former undersecretary of state for political affairs in the George W. Bush administration, now a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School. And Ambassador Burns, good to have you with us today."", 'Nice to be with you.', ""And when the president of the United States says it's not clear who we talk to in Tehran, that is of concern."", 'It is. I actually think that President Obama has done a really fine job over the last 12 months in positioning the United States to be, in essence, a country that can pressure Iran, can offer negotiations as he has done, but be in a position now to put together a major international coalition to sanction the Iranians.', ""It's this combination of efforts that we probably need. It's a very chaotic time in Iran. The opposition is stronger in Iran. I think the Iranian government is feeling the heat from its own opposition, and it may be trying to create a diversion by acting out the way it is and acting up, by being so provocative as to say they're going to enrich uranium up to 20 percent, they're going to build nuclear power plants, that kind of thing."", ""So I think that President Obama's strategy is - I think he's positioned the United States well to be effective in a very complex and even dangerous game that's going to be played out over the next six to 12 months."", 'Did he - I know this statement just came out, but did the president, to your ears, seem to be speaking to the rather mercurial president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and also to the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Khamenei?', ""Well, I suspect, but I don't know for sure, that in essence, it's probably not going to be possible to influence the Iranian leadership at this point. If they ever wanted to have an opportunity to negotiate with the United States - it has been 30 years, Neal, since there have been serious, substantive, continued talks between our two countries, 30 years - they had that chance over the last 12 months with President Obama. He offered them, time and again, an avenue towards negotiations. There was this compromise that Mike Shuster talked about by the U.S., Europe, China and Russia to try to take enriched uranium out of the country, return it for medical isotopes for their medical reactors, and the Iranians have turned that down."", ""And they've now basically said over the last 24 hours, we're going our own way, we're going to ramp up and increase our enrichment program, and I think that President Obama now has no alternative but to do what he said today he would do, and that's to put together a coalition of countries that would do a couple of things."", ""One is to pass, at the U.N. Security Council, very tough, targeted sanctions, economic sanctions, against Iran; second, to continue in effect to contain Iran's power, because the United States military, of course, our Navy is in the Gulf, and our military is in Iraq and Afghanistan, we're in a position to, in effect, prevent the Iranians from using their new-found power in the region."", 'Continue to offer negotiations because it may be that these sanctions, the real impact of the sanctions will be to bring Iran back to negotiations.', 'And finally, I think what the Obama administration needs to do is to be much more clear about our support for the opposition, for the people in the streets who want a better life and who want freedom. I think if I had to recommend anything, and I admire what President Obama has done so far, I would say the U.S. should be more vocal in supporting the people who want democracy and freedom in Iran.', ""One more question for you from me, then we'll get to the listeners who are anxious to discuss the options ahead in Iran, and that is the idea of sanctions. Well, if sanctions are to be effectives, we've learned over the years, two things need to apply. One, they need to be very unanimous. The world, the entire world, has to apply them. And the other is they take time."", ""The problem with the first one is that Iran has something a lot of people want, and that's oil; and the other one is Iran is - what, two, three years away from a nuclear weapon."", ""And you're right, Neal. These are very, very short timelines that we're talking about. I think the issue of sanctions is a very tough one. Sanctions, as you suggest, are nearly always an imperfect instrument, and they do not usually succeed in international politics because you need to get nearly universal application of the sanctions."", ""In this case, I think the United States can rely upon the European powers, particularly France and Britain, who have been very stalwart. I agree with Mike Shuster that it seems that the Russians are now tacking towards the United States and the West Europeans because they're so frustrated with the inconsistencies and unreliability of the Iranian government."", ""The key country will be China. China has become the largest trade partner of Iran. China is a major purchaser of Iranian oil and gas. China tends to have a foreign policy that's - that is more mercantile, more mercantilistic than anything else. It focuses on its commercial base."", 'China needs to reflect seriously, if it wants to be a global leader, about how to be a responsible global leader and to be in the middle of this effort toward - on sanctions not at the edge of it or not even blocking the sanctions, which I suspect the Chinese may be planning to do.', ""Let's get some callers on the line. We'll begin with Peter, Peter calling us from Berkeley."", 'Hi, thanks for this opportunity. I remember hearing Ambassador Burns recently on Charlie Rose quote Winston Churchill: Keep calm and carry on. I wrote that down and thought about it a lot.', 'The people of the world will have peace when they learn to take each other seriously.', ""And I was just wondering how we can possibly offer, as an international community, Iran more of what it needs vis-Ã -vis security and recognition and respect, whatever it is, participation maybe in - I don't know, a global televised dialogue would be one idea - but offer it in such a way that we can get the concessions we need from them better rather than both sides, you know, whether posturing or fighting each other and threatening."", ""Well, Peter, I thank you very much for what you've said, and I think you're right that this is a time when Americans need to think very carefully about the patient application of diplomacy towards a very difficult international problem."", ""My own view, for what it's worth, is that it would be a major error to think that military force can resolve this by its own. It cannot, and the prospect of a third war is really forbidding for our country. We have enough on our hands with Iraq and Afghanistan."", ""I admire what President Obama has done, because I think he's really taken - he's really kind of tried to honor what you've been saying, what you said in your comments. We do need to talk after an absence of dialogue of 30 years. We need conversations among religious leaders, among political leaders, and he gave them an opportunity, but they have turned him down."", ""The Iranian government has refused to meet the United States at the negotiating table. So I think for the time being the president has no alternative but to go for sanctions, but I think that the application of sanctions might actually lead the Iranians back to negotiations if they're sufficiently isolated, if they're sufficiently pressured, and my suspicion, and I don't know this for sure, because I'm not part of this administration, but I'm sure the administration wants to avoid a war."", ""I'm sure that these steps are designed to lead us towards, at some point, a peaceful resolution of disputes, but the president needs to be tough-minded. I think his statements today were, and I think we ought to try to support where he's leading us on Iran."", ""Can I ask you, please, to elaborate a little bit on this 30 years since no substantial discussions, if I'm saying that right. Well, that goes back, while the shah was in power, weren't we talking with the shah a lot? What do you mean by that?"", 'Thirty-one years since the revolution come Thursday.', 'Really?', 'Yeah, yeah.', ""Yes, since the Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran, since the Islamic revolution. Of course we had a hostage crisis right during those years, 1978, which didn't end until January 20, 1981. Since then, we have not had diplomatic relations with Iran. We've had episodic contacts at various international meetings, you know, one administration - each administration, but we've never had a time when the two governments sat down for days, weeks, months and said: Look at all the issues that separate us - nuclear weapons, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iranian support for Hezbollah and Hamas - we've never talked about them."", ""We've never had that opportunity. I'm not aware of any country in the world where we haven't had a substantial, meaningful conversation over the same time period. You think of it, we've talked to the North Koreans, we've talked to the Cubans, but we haven't talked to the Iranians. And it would be foolish indeed for us to be on a war footing with a country that we knew so little about. And so I am very much for a dialogue and negotiation, but it takes two to tango."", ""It takes, you know, a negotiating partner. And in this case, I think President Obama has really tried, but he's been turned down. And so, again, I'd say I think he has no recourse but to seek these sanctions."", ""An email we have from Michael in Boulder, Colorado. We get a lot of these every time we raise this issue. I don't understand how anyone can discuss a nuclear Iran without mentioning the nuclear arsenal of Israel. If a nuclear-free Middle East is desired, it is impossible to avoid talking about both - unless you're the U.S. media, it seems."", ""Well, we'll talk about it right now on NPR. But my sense is that Israel is a responsible, democratic government of a democratic country. And I really don't think you can compare Israel to the situation in Iran. We have an autocratic government which is a mendacious government, a government that has not met its international commitment. And it's lied to the United Nations and to the rest of the world about what it's doing to enrich uranium time and again. And so I just don't think there's a moral comparison between these two countries."", 'In terms of the...', '...two governments, I should say.', ""I understand. In terms of international obligations, Iran's derived from the fact that it was a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a treaty which Israel has never signed."", ""Iran is a signatory of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. But the reason why Iran has been sanctioned three times by the U.N. Security Council - 2006, '07 and '08 - is because it's fundamentally violated both commitments that it did make in writing to the NPT."", ""You know, when President Obama and President Sarkozy and Prime Minister Brown announced in September at that press conference in New York that Iran had this facility near the holy city of Qom that it hadn't told the rest of the world about it, that exposed an Iranian lie. And when the Security Council found out many years ago - several years ago that Iran had been enriching uranium, that exposed an Iranian lie to the international community."", ""So I really don't think it's possible to compare the behavior and attitudes of the Iranian and Israeli governments. They're two very - and we're allied, in a sense, to Israel. We have a commitment to Israel. And Israel's democratic nature, I think, makes it a very responsible country, whereas Iran's autocratic government has been very irresponsible in the way it's dealt with the rest of the world."", 'Now a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, Nicholas Burns served as undersecretary of state for political affairs in the Bush administration.', ""You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."", ""And let's get Nick on the line, Nick with us from Winchester in Virginia."", 'Hi. This is - from Winchester.', 'Yes. Go ahead, please.', ""Okay. Thank you. Undersecretary Burns, I'm a retired Foreign Service officer, and my own feeling is that we have a history of not speaking bluntly with the Iranians going back to the time when we didn't let the shah in immediately for medical treatment. But specifically - and several years ago, the National Intelligence Estimate was that Iran was in - was proceeding with a nuclear armaments program. Two or three years later, the - a new report said they had ceased in 2005, I believe. The flipside of it is that they have been lying like rugs, as you pointed out, up until that time."", ""And Nick, we appreciate the history lesson. Can you - if there's a question?"", ""No. Yeah. The question is, I think that as a part of our diplomacy, we should be absolutely blunt about every lie we have caught them in. And if we want to go back for 30 years, that's fine. I just like - I just want - think that they should be - we should be pointing out to the world, as well as reminding the Iranians, that they have a history of lying to us ever since 1979. And that we have bent over backwards to..."", ""Nick, let's get a response to that. I want to leave room for another person's question."", 'Thank you.', ""Thank you. Thanks, Nick, very much for your comment. I would just say that it's important for us to distinguish, as I think we're doing, between the Iranian government and Iranian people. One of the great ironies of the modern Middle East is that the Iranian people tend to have a very favorable view of the United States. The Iranian government, of course, does not."", ""It has been a government, this new militarized government of - in Iran that has lied consistently to the international community, to the United Nations and to the U.S., and so we shouldn't be shy about saying that. I think President Bush was very forthright in making a case that Iran's actions to support terrorism and to promote this nuclear weapons future was a great concern, not just for the U.S., but the whole world. And I think President Obama has done the same. And so both of our presidents, I think, have been very forthright."", 'And now, I think, we need to be patient. We need to be sure that a combination of diplomacy, negotiations and sanctions I think still might be effective to avoid a war that we should surely try to avoid.', ""Let's see if we can get one last caller in. Scott's joining us from Jackson, Michigan."", ""Hi. I just wanted to make a comment that I think the basic problem you have in dealing with Iran is they're like the mythical dog Cerberus. They're the thing with three heads. Basically, when you're dealing with Iran, you've got a secular government. You've got the Revolutionary Guard, and, of course, you've got the theocracy, the Ayatollahs. And so, basically - and I don't see that any three of - any one of those institutions actually has absolute control over what happens in Iran. Furthermore, if they did get a nuclear weapon, the really alarming thing about that would be is who would have absolutely control over it? Would it be the Revolutionary Guard, or would it be the secular government, you know? Who knows?"", ""Scott, that's a very good comment. And I guess I'd agree with you that part of the problem - and President Obama mentioned this in his press conference today - is who are we dealing with? Who's making decisions in Tehran since the June 12th elections, the elections that were so blatantly unfair?"", ""The Iranian government seems to be more militarized, more dominated not just by the mullahs, but by the Revolutionary Guard. And that's very disturbing, because the Revolutionary Guard is a hard-line, far-right, intolerant group of people who want to impose not only their own brand of Islam on the Iranian people, but want to impose an autocratic government on them."", ""That element in Iran has not - does not want to reach out to the United States, does not want negotiations, and I think wants to build towards confrontation. So dealing with them, I think, has to be done not just by the U.S., but by the international community. And that's why it's going to be so important that Russia and particularly China become much more tough-minded and realistic about Iran and join us in the sanctions and put the kind of pressure on Iran that might lead us away from a confrontation and back towards some ground, common ground where we can have a diplomatic settlement, a negotiated settlement..."", ""And I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there.

Awlaki had been linked to terrorist attacks against the United States and was a key target for several years. NPR's Rachel Martin shares the latest with host Scott Simon.,"[""This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. United States has targeted and killed a U.S. citizen late this week. His name: Anwar al-Awlaki and he was key operative for al-Qaida's affiliate in Yemen. Awlaki found himself on the target list because he was linked to several terrorist plots that were aimed at killing Americans. Here's President Obama yesterday:"", 'He directed the failed attempt to blow up an airplane on Christmas Day in 2009. He directed the failed attempt to blow up U.S. cargo planes in 2010. And he repeatedly called on individuals in the United States and around the globe to kill innocent men, women and children to advance a murderous agenda.', ""Awlaki's death raises questions now about America's tactics and the future of al-Qaida. NPR's Rachel Martin joins us. Rachel, thanks for being with us."", ""You're welcome."", ""And let's start with Awlaki. Clearly, this was someone the U.S. had in the crosshairs."", ""Exactly right, Scott. As President Obama said yesterday, this was a man directly linked to several high-profile terrorist attacks over the last couple of years. But it is important to note that his role over time actually evolved. He hadn't always been so operationally involved. One incident the president didn't mention there was the shooting at Fort Hood. Remember in 2009, 13 Americans died in the attack when an Army major opened fire at the base. That major, Nidal Hasan, is said to have had email communication with Awlaki. And that case illustrated one part of what he was so important, because he inspired others to violent action with his message."", 'I gather he had a more direct role in some of the later plots too.', ""Yes, particularly that Christmas Day plot in 2009. Awlaki wasn't just exchanging emails in that case. He was the architect of that plot against the United States. And this is what Awlaki was all about. Even though his group al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula had been focused on more regional issues and targets, Awlaki was intent on waging attacks transnationally on the United States and he worked to reorient the focus of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. So, when you talk to intelligence officials these days - and they say this publicly - that the greatest terrorist threat to the United States is coming from Yemen, not Pakistan, which is the base to al-Qaida's core leadership."", 'And where does this death now leave al-Qaida?', 'Well, Scott, this is the latest in a series of very high-profile killings over the last few years and especially the last few months. Of course, the most significant episode was the killing of Osama bin Laden in May. But since then, according to the U.S. government now, there have been at least seven people who they characterize as senior al-Qaida leaders who\'ve been killed in strikes. That doesn\'t include Awlaki and the man who was actually killed with him - his name was Samir Kahn. He was another American very close to Awlaki. But Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said earlier this summer al-Qaida is on the brink of, quote, ""strategic defeat."" But it\'s important to note U.S. officials are still concerned that some branch of the group or some lone wolf could carry out a major attack in the United States. Because there is always this chance that when you kill one al-Qaida leader, another person just steps in to fill in the void.', 'Let me ask you about the legal questions that have been raised, because yesterday voices from Ron Paul to the American Civil Liberties Union said it is illegal to target a U.S. citizen.', ""And this is a big debate. You know, on one side there is an argument that he is a citizen, he has legal rights. The ACLU actually had filed a lawsuit about a year on behalf of Awlaki's father. It was thrown out and never really addressed the core question. But the ACLU put out a statement yesterday raising legal questions about Awlaki's killing. But the U.S. government is clear here, Scott. They say this was legal. And this is what Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta actually said yesterday on CNN."", ""If you're a terrorist, you're a terrorist. And that means that we have the ability to go after those who would threaten to attack the United States and kill Americans. There's no question that the authority and the ability to go after a terrorist is there."", 'So, the U.S. government argues that when someone, even an American citizen, joins the enemy in an ongoing war against the U.S., that person becomes a legitimate target.', ""NPR's Rachel Martin.

Trump is promising to act, as he did once before. But action is more complicated this time.","[""It's been nearly a week since the suspected chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria. And it's been four days since President Trump said a decision would be made on a U.S. response within 24 to 48 hours. Administration officials say he has not yet made a decision. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports."", 'President Trump has repeatedly criticized his predecessor, President Obama, for setting a red line in Syria...', 'A red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.', '...And then ultimately not responding with military force when that red line was crossed.', ""I will seek authorization for the use of force from the American people's representatives in Congress."", ""That congressional authorization never came. And ultimately Russia offered a diplomatic off-ramp to ensure that chemical weapons weren't used again in Syria. Last year, after the Assad regime did use chemical weapons again, Trump was asked about Obama's red line."", 'I think that set us back a long ways not only in Syria but in many other parts of the world because it was a blank threat.', 'Trump said he felt a responsibility to act.', 'It crossed a lot of lines for me - when you kill innocent children, innocent babies - babies - little babies.', 'And he did respond. Just two days after the attack, the U.S. launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at an airbase in Syria. But almost exactly a year later, President Trump again found himself responding to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack.', ""We'll be making that decision very quickly - probably by the end of today. But we cannot allow atrocities like that - cannot allow it."", 'That was Monday. Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted that missiles would be coming - quote, ""nice, new and smart."" But at this point, there is still no decision on what action to take. Why was it so quick and easy for President Trump to make a decision a year ago and now not so much? Former U.S. ambassador to Syria Robert Ford says one reason is because last year\'s one-off, isolated strike only stopped Assad from using chemical weapons for a few months. This time around, it will likely require a more sustained response.', ""A one-time strike won't be enough. They'll have to think about kind of a broader set of targets and maybe not just one day but maybe several days to drive the point home to Assad. And then if he tests us again in three or four months, again the Americans will have to respond."", 'And Ford says such a response would take longer to put together.', ""They're doing a pretty careful assessment of targets. And the second thing they're doing is working diplomatically to extract maximum gain and minimize risk."", 'More broadly, the situation is just more complicated a year on, says Richard Fontaine, president of the Center for a New American Security. U.S. allies including the U.K. and France want to be part of the response. Russia and Iran are even more involved in Syria than they were last year. And the Syrian civil war is a year further along, with Assad holding more territory. And Fontaine adds there is still no apparent U.S. strategy for dealing with Syria outside of a focus on knocking out ISIS.', 'How the United States envisions the future of Syria and what American interests are in that country and how we intend to pursue them still remain pretty unclear beyond the ISIS question.', 'And those sorts of questions take a lot longer than 24 or 48 hours to answer.

And you have to understand that even if we undertake strikes this time, we might have to again. I don't think anyone could promise that, you know, it all ends if we just show how tough we are. But I think we can say, we are going to make you pay a price for doing this. And if you choose to use chemical weapons again in the same way, we'll do it again."", ""How to square what may seem to some people like a disconnect between President Trump making very clear he wants out of Syria; he's done? He's telegraphed that clearly. He would like to bring U.S. troops home - on the other hand saying there has to be a big price to pay for this apparent chemical attack and raising the specter of yet more military engagement in Syria."", ""Yeah, those two things don't have to be incompatible. Indeed, I think there's a real scenario where President Trump does both of those things at the same time. That is to say, pull out our troops 'cause he doesn't want to be in a mess on the ground and spending money and getting involved in a civil war but also, you know, bombing from far away, which is lower cost and lower risk. Indeed, you could even argue that if we're going to start undertaking airstrikes in Syria, that you could make a case you don't want troops on the ground. That would be vulnerable and could drag you in. So there's, like I say, a real chance that that's where we end up - doing the airstrikes but also pulling out on the ground at the same time."", ""Last thing - I should just note - today is day one on the job for President Trump's new national security adviser John Bolton. What is your sense of where he lands on what to do about Syria?"", ""Yeah, one reason I think it's highly likely that the United States is going to act militarily here - it's not just because I and others think it's the right thing to do. But with John Bolton starting this week in the White House, to have the president warn on Twitter that there's a big price to pay and having made clear that we're not going to tolerate use of weapons of mass destruction and wanting to signal that the administration wants to stand up to Iran - after all that, to not act in Bolton's first week on the job would really undermine everything the administration is trying to do about showing that it's tough and willing to stand up to adversaries. So I think Bolton will be arguing strongly for a military response. And I think that the president is going to be very supportive of doing that."", 'Thanks very much.', 'Nice to talk to you.

If they don't, the nation will default on its loans. Host Scott Simon talks to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, about the obstacles to a deal, what a short-term deal might look like, and the consequences of no deal being reached at all.","['President Obama all but hit the roof on the debt ceiling debate this week. At a midweek news conference, the president scolded Congress for failing to reach a deal and effectively held its members after school.', 'If by the end of this week we have not seen substantial progress, then I think members of Congress need to understand we are going to, you know, start having to cancel things and stay here until we get it done.', ""Now, part of the scolding seemed to work. The Senate has cancelled its July 4th week recess and will stay in the capital in an attempt to hammer out a deal. The negotiations were made more urgent yesterday when the Treasury Department said that a deal must be struck by July 22nd to avert a government default by August 2nd. House Speaker John Boehner charged that President Obama has been AWOL himself from the debt limit debate. We're joined now by Mark Zandi. He's chief economist of Moody's Analytics and he joins us from West Chester, Pennsylvania. Mark, thanks so much for being with us."", 'Thank you.', 'What do you make of the way the president used the famous bully pulpit this week?', ""Well, I think he's sounding the alarm bells, and I think he should. I think it's vital that Congress and the administration come together and raise this debt ceiling limit in the next couple, three weeks because if they don't I think we're going to have a mess on our hands."", 'Describe that mess.', ""What will happen is we'll come back from our July 4th weekend. By mid-July, if there's no progress, I think global investors will start getting nervous. They'll attach probability to the possibility that the debt ceiling isn't increased by August 2nd. Financial markets will become increasingly unsettled. By the end of July I think they will very unsettled. If nothing happens by August 2nd, I think it'll be turmoil. I think interest rates will rise. I think stock prices will fall. I think the dollar will fall in value."", 'So, you take this deadline as real, not just an attempt to focus the mind?', ""It's very real. I think the Treasury runs out of options and will literally have to balance the budget overnight. And, of course, we're running a $1.3, $1.4 trillion annual budget deficit. So, that means draconian cuts to lots of everything - Social Security payments, Medicare, everything in between - and I think that would just send the economy into a recession."", 'So, what would August 3 look like under this scenario?', ""Well, come August 3, the Treasury is going to have to start making some hard choices. Somebody's not going to get their money. Now, they probably certainly would give IOUs but the checks would stop flowing. And pretty soon - I think they have a Social Security payment due a few days later - I don't think they'd have enough cash to pay all the money they're obligated to to those Social Security recipients, so they wouldn't get all their money. They'd get an IOU but they wouldn't get all their cash. And, of course, the cash problems will just intensify with each passing day and the cost to the economy, the damage to the economy would mount."", ""The president sounded a little optimistic at Wednesday's news conference in this sense. Let's listen to what President Obama said:"", ""I think there's a conceptual framework that would allow us to make huge progress on our debt and deficit and do so in a way that does not hurt our economy right here and right now."", 'Mark, do you share that view?', ""Yeah. You know, I'm optimistic that policymakers are going to get it together here in time to avert a real problem. I think there is a reasonable amount of commonality between the parties. I think everyone's onboard with the amount of deficit reduction we need to do - four trillion over the next decade. And I think there's agreement on big aspects of how to achieve that. So, I think this is increasingly just a question of politics and not economics. It's a matter just signing on the dotted line, finding the political will to do that, and I think, you know, when push comes to shove they'll figure it out."", 'Does that mean that Democrats have to accept cuts and Republicans have to accept tax increases?', ""Yeah, I think so. I think we need to find a compromise. I think there's already agreement with respect to sizeable spending cuts. I think the debate right now is with regard to tax revenue increases, whether there will be any and what form they'll take."", ""Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.

There had been some concerns about that here after the U.S. adjusted its plans to base missile defense facilities in Poland back in 2009.', 'Today, in a somewhat symbolic gesture, the White House announced plans to station a contingent of Air Force personnel in Poland.', ""The second part of the president's message here is to highlight the success of Poland and other former East Bloc countries in making the transition to democracy."", 'One of the important roles that Poland can play is not just as a promoter of ideas but as a living example of what is possible when countries take reform seriously.', 'Democracy activists from Poland are already sharing their experience with would-be reformers in the Middle East.

Members of the G-8 were generally receptive to that idea but I should say, Scott, so far any actual pledges of financial support have been fairly limited', ""There was, of course, a lot of attention to the president's speech to the British parliament. There had been some skepticism during the early part of his administration as to whether President Obama was as committed to the special relationship with Britain and Europe as some of his predecessors. What did this speech do to affect that?"", ""Yeah, that's really been a big message for this whole trip, is that as far as the president is concerned, Europe still matters. It still has a very big role to play on the world stage. And he underscored that in his speech to the British parliament earlier in the week. He was speaking in the historic Westminster Hall. It was a very formal setting. He was interrupted just once by applause.

Well, the Polish prime minister had said he felt like Mr. Obama was one of them, and Mr. Obama said, well, if you're from Chicago and you're not a little bit Polish there must be something wrong with you.

Bowe Bergdahl left his combat post in Afghanistan. He has pleaded guilty to two serious charges. The judge could let Bergdahl walk free or sentence him to life in prison.","[""A military judge is preparing to sentence Bowe Bergdahl. He's the Army sergeant who walked away from his combat post in one of the most dangerous parts of Afghanistan back in 2009. The Taliban captured Bergdahl and held him for five years. He was released as part of an exchange. President Obama freed five Taliban members held at Guantanamo Bay in return for Bergdahl. Here's Obama speaking with Bergdahl's parents at the White House in 2014."", 'As president, I know that I speak for all Americans when I say that we cannot wait for the moment when you are reunited and your son, Bowe, is back in your arms.', ""But many were critical of the deal that freed Bowe Bergdahl, and last week he pled guilty to desertion and to endangering his fellow soldiers. Bergdahl's sentencing hearing opens this morning. NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre is covering it from Fort Bragg, N.C., where it's taking place. Hi, Greg."", 'Hi, Rachel.', 'What sort of testimony are we likely to hear today?', ""Well, quite a range. This - consider this sort of a mini trial that could go on for a couple days. Bergdahl himself could speak at some point. We're expecting that, but we're also likely to hear from one or more members of the military who were injured and perhaps somebody who was badly injured while searching for Bergdahl. Many in the military community say that there were soldiers killed in the search for Bergdahl over the years. The Army has not found direct proof of that, and we don't expect that to be introduced into the case, but we could hear from a wide range of people. This case has stirred a lot of passion, and we may get some very emotional testimony in the coming days."", 'Any idea what kind of sentence the judge might hand down?', ""No, we don't. And that's what makes this really fascinating. The judge, who's an Army colonel, Jeffrey Nance, has huge discretion here. He could let Bergdahl walk free. He could say that the five years he served in Taliban captivity is punishment enough. It was very harsh. He was tortured. He was beaten. But at the other extreme, he could also give him life in prison. The charge that Bergdahl pleaded guilty to last week, endangering his comrades, or, technically, misbehavior in front of the enemy, does potentially carry a life sentence. So there's this wide range of outcomes that we could see in the case here."", 'I mean, this is such an unusual case for so many reasons. Some people in our audience might know that the podcast ""Serial"" actually focused its second season on the Bowe Bergdahl case, and that\'s just one of several external factors that could potentially have an impact on this decision, right?', ""No. Exactly, Rachel. People have heard from Bergdahl in his own voice providing a very detailed description of why he did this. He said he walked off his base because he didn't feel his unit was being run properly. And he had this notion, quite crazy, certainly, in retrospect, that he was going to walk 20 miles or nearly 20 miles across a very dangerous part of Afghanistan and reach a higher-level officer and explain what was going on. So there's that issue. Again, his release was a trade for five Taliban members who are still in Qatar and being monitored there. An Army psychiatrist has found that Bergdahl shows signs of a personality disorder. So there are people on all sides here who say Bergdahl really needs to be punished or Bergdahl has suffered enough. And we're going to wait and see what the judge hands down."", 'And of course even President Trump has weighed in on this.', 'Yes, he has, and he theoretically should not as the commander in chief of the military.', ""NPR's Greg Myre at Fort Bragg, N.C.

And Perry has really vaulted to the top of the polls nationally and in key states. He's got support from voters all across the Republican primary spectrum. And so the Perry and Mitt Romney rivalry will be the main show at the Reagan Library debate and at the one shortly afterward in Florida, Nevada and New Hampshire. Somebody is probably going to take Perry on. We're going to have to see who it is. This does look like a two-man race right now. The next six weeks will confirm that."", ""So, I'm sure the Romney is cringing a little bit when you call Rick Perry the frontrunner. What does Mitt Romney have to do to regain what he hoped was his position, the frontrunner position?"", ""Well, one of the things the Romney people will say is it's not too bad not to be the frontrunner at this point in the race. But you're right; Romney has to start acting like he's running against his fellow Republicans. So far, he's been running against the president. And that is a general election strategy that makes a lot of sense if you're the frontrunner, which right now he's not anymore. He is taking steps in that direction to change his strategy. For instance, he's going to a Republican candidates' forum in South Carolina put on by the influential conservative Senator Jim DeMint after earlier saying he wasn't going to go. South Carolina is a very important early primary state. He's also extending an olive branch to the Tea Party. He's going to attend a Tea Party rally today in New Hampshire. And last week, he made a trip to Perry's own backyard. He gave a speech to the VFW in Texas, where he emphasized his business background and contrasted it to Perry's decades in politics. Here's part of what he said:"", ""Now, I'm a conservative businessman. I spent most of my life outside politics dealing with real problems in the real economy. Career politicians got us into this mess and they simply don't know how to get us out."", ""So, it remains to be seen if voters will look at Perry as a career politician or not. But Romney really has a choice. He can sit back and hope Perry's brashness and the new scrutiny of Perry's record leads him to implode on his own, or take the fight to him, and I think he's doing a little bit of both."", ""Let's talk about the man. This is all about President Obama planning to deliver a speech to the joint session of Congress on Thursday. He alluded to jobs in his weekly radio address. We have a clip of that here:"", ""There's a lot of talk in Washington these days about creating jobs. But it doesn't help when those same folks turn around and risk losing hundreds of thousands of jobs just because of political gamesmanship. We need to pass this transportation bill and put people to work rebuilding America."", 'Not a whole lot of detail here, but what should we expect from the president going into this week?', ""Well, the backdrop for the big speech that he's going to give on Thursday are these dismal Labor Department jobs figures that were released on Friday - no job growth at all in August. That's why the Republicans are now calling him President Zero. But Obama is going to be coming to Congress on Thursday to give his big jobs speech at a time when he has few fiscal policy tools left. He can't propose a 2009-style stimulus package. He's also coming at a time when his own standing with the public, particularly on his handling of the economy, is at an all-time low. And the number of people who think he's a strong leader has also plummeted. So, there is a lot of pressure on the president to lay out something not necessarily that will get Republican votes - because that's probably not possible - but a plan that will strike most people as something that would help the unemployment picture if it is was enacted."", 'NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

He stopped short of endorsing same-sex marriage, however, frustrating some of his supporters in the gay community. For more, guest host Susan Stamberg talks with New York Times Los Angeles Bureau Chief Adam Nagourney.","[""The recent decision by New York's state legislature to legalize same-sex marriage is being viewed by many as a tipping point, an important milestone in the gay rights movement. But this attention to the issue of gay marriage is putting President Barack Obama in the hot seat. Here's the president speaking during a news conference in December 2010."", ""With respect to this issue of whether gays and lesbians should be able to get married, I've spoken about this recently. As I said, you know, my feelings about this are constantly evolving. I struggle with this."", 'This past week, Mr. Obama spoke at a White House reception held in honor of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or LGBT, pride month.', ""So, we've got a lot of work to do, not only on ending discrimination; we've got a lot of work to do to live up to the ideals on which we were founded and to preserve the American dream in our time for everybody, whether they're gay or straight or lesbian or transgender."", 'What is perceived as Mr. Obama\'s ambiguity on same-sex marriage is frustrating some of his supporters on the left. So, we begin this hour by examining the relationship between the Obama administration and gay rights activists. Adam Nagourney is our guest. A long-time political reporter, he\'s Los Angeles bureau chief for the New York Times and he is co-author of ""Out for Good: The Struggle to Build a Gay Rights Movement in America."" He joins us from his office in California. Adam Nagourney, welcome.', 'Hey, thanks for having me.', ""Do you think that President Obama's personal evolution is genuine or is it politically expedient? 'Cause after all same-sex marriage is politically untenable in many parts of this country."", ""Yeah, I think - I mean, just sort of knowing President Obama and following him over the years - and I don't know what's inside his heart. I just find it difficult to believe that he really opposes gay marriage or that it's that big an issue to him. And in fact when he ran for Senate he signed some sort of application - not application but some sort of questionnaire - in which he said he supported gay marriage. Here's the thing though: I do not think that he could have gotten elected president in 2008 as a proponent of gay marriage. It just wasn't going to happen. And my guess is - you know, I don't know - but my guess is that he made a pugle(ph) calculation to play down that issue in order to get elected. And, you know, purists could argue that that was a bad thing to do. Pragmatic people would say, listen, you got to get into office to get stuff done, so he did it. Whatever. My guess is that's what he's done."", ""I wonder how much is generational. He's sort of on the edge of being part of a generation that does not see all this as much of a big deal."", ""If you look at polling, I think the cutoff age is 45 or 40. You begin to see a real difference in public perceptions of gay marriage, and younger people are - by the way, this crosses party lines too - either they support gay marriage or they just don't care for a whole lot of reasons. I mean, I just think culturally the world's changing. The fact that so many gay people came out in the '80s and '90s and the 2000s means that it's more sort of acceptable. What's been going on on television is a huge deal, that so many shows have openly gay characters. So, I think that's going on. And he is - you're right, Susan - he is right on the cusp, but still that said, he came out of a very sort of liberal background in Chicago and, you know, I assume there were plenty of gay people in this life. And that's where my sort of supposition or inclination is that this is probably not an issue that he really he ever had much of a problem with, frankly."", ""In the past and, again, at this news conference he held this past week, he characterized same-sex marriage as a state's rights issue. Here's a bit of what he said:"", ""What you saw was the people of New York having a debate, talking through these issues. It was contentious, it was emotional, but ultimately they made a decision to recognize civil marriages. And I think that's exactly how things should work."", ""So, that's President Obama at a news conference just last week. Adam Nagourney, why do you think he takes that position and what is the response to it from gay activists?"", ""You know, gay activists really slammed him on that position. I think it really distressed them because it seemed to be a real step back from the evolution, evolving position that the White House had been suggesting is where the president is. It's a difficult argument to make because, you know, obviously, if you accept what sounded like a state's rights argument then you get into a situation of, of course, that was the same way that many states banned marriages between blacks and whites. And Barack Obama parents were also black and white, so I'm not sure that's a place where he wants to be. And I'm not sure that's a place where he meant to end up as he's trying to sort of mull his way through this. And my guess again is at the end of the day he's going to come out in some form for gay marriage."", 'The business about marriage equality is that really for the gay rights activists at the top of their list in general or is it symbolic for the overall issue of gay rights?', ""Yeah, that's a really good question. You know, I wrote a book about the gay political movement going back to Stonewall and when this movement first began, yeah, there were some people who supported and wanted gay marriage. But for a lot of people that was not a big issue. There were much other issues that were considered much bigger: police harassment, sodomy laws. And there are in fact a lot of people in the gay community who would say we don't care about marriage, it's a straight convention. We don't need it; we don't want it. I think, though, that very recently this issue's become a surrogate. In other words, people who might normally not care about it, it's become a big deal, and I think that it's become the biggest deal of the gay rights movement now because it's sort of become representative of gay people trying to get accepted by society. And so I do think it's a huge deal. And that's why, for example, that's why Andrew Cuomo got so much credit in New York for pushing it through. I think it's become bigger than it ever was, again, because it's become symbolic sort of the larger movement."", 'Adam Nagourney, Los Angeles bureau chief for the New York Times.

How does this bill handle those issues?', ""Well, first, on Medicaid, which covers, like, 70 million people, this would roll back the expansion, which itself extended coverage to about 10 million people. And then it just changes the basic program. Right now, Medicaid pays for whatever health care the people in the program need. There's really no limit, which Republicans see as a big problem. This bill caps that spending, and some estimates say that over time, it'll reduce the spending on the program by about 25 percent."", ""As far as pre-existing conditions go, it allows states to get out of a lot of the rules imposed by Obamacare. So under this bill, if you're in a state that gets a waiver, your insurance policy may not cover some of the basic things that we expect now - mental health care, prescription drugs or hospitalizations."", 'OK, talking about the new health care proposal from Republicans - and it is looking like it could be a very close vote count in the Senate at this point.', 'Sure does.', ""NPR's Alison Kodjak, thanks, as always.

He did not, for example, set benchmarks for measuring progress, and he did not set a timeline for when the U.S. might one day leave Afghanistan. That's a theme that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis picked up on yesterday. Let's listen to him. This is him talking yesterday at the annual Air Force conference."", 'Victory would look like the people and the government of Afghanistan can handle this threat from the terrorists using their own security forces, with international mentors probably there for many years to come.', ""What would victory look like?

He made clear his expectation is U.S. troops will not return to any combat roles, he's saying. They will stick, as far as he's concerned, to training roles, advisory roles, helping Afghan security forces. He did give one new detail that was really interesting. This is about how much of the region he plans to secure within four years. Let's listen."", ""The four-year plan involves the goal of really bringing 80 percent of the territory of the country under control. It involves doubling our commando force that's probably the best in the region. A new generation is taking over. And the overhaul of the security forces I think is proceeding very well is - and on course."", 'And I know that this plan, when you came out of the conversation, Mary Louise - that the question is how new this is. And I want to pose that question to NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman, who has spent a lot of time reporting on and in Afghanistan.', 'Hi, Tom.', 'Hey, David.', 'So this specific plan - security forces controlling 80 percent of the country within four years - is this new?', ""You know, it is new. We haven't heard that before. Right now, the Afghan government controls roughly 60 percent of the country. And that means about one-third of Afghans, or 11 million people, are living under Taliban control or in areas contested with the Taliban, and this is mostly in the south around Kandahar and Helmand."", ""And, you know, people I talk with say it's going to be very difficult to reach that 80 percent goal in four years. One person I spoke with said it's overly optimistic. Another said he'll be struggling to reach that goal. And there are a variety of reasons."", ""First of all, there's great corruption in the country. There's a lot of - there's a lack of leadership in the military.

Barack Obama voted against raising the limit back when he was a senator, something he later regretted when he got to the White House.', 'That was just a - a example of a new senator, you know, making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country.', ""Many of you have questions about why the United States imposes this limit on the government's ability to borrow. And our co-host Rachel Martin put those questions to commentator Cokie Roberts in our regular segment Ask Cokie."", ""Let's just get right to our first question. It is about the fundamentals of this whole exercise of raising the debt ceiling, and it comes through Twitter from Sarah Eggers, and she asks the following. (Reading) Why did we invent the debt ceiling? What was its intended purpose?"", ""Well, it's a good question, since hardly any other country has a debt ceiling. But the Constitution gives Congress the sole power to authorize borrowing against the credit of the United States. And throughout the - basically the first century plus, individual projects were each financed separately. So Congress had to pass borrowing authority to build the Panama Canal, for instance, or to fight the Spanish-American War. So the debt limit was introduced in World War I as a way to give the Treasury and the brand-new Federal Reserve more flexibility in issuing war bonds. Two thirds of that war was paid for by borrowing."", ""So as a country, we've just been borrowing and borrowing ever since, it seems like, which leads to our next question. This one was sent by Jenn Berry, who asks, (reading) why is Congress able to authorize raising the debt ceiling instead of staying under budget like we're supposed to?"", ""Well, that gets to the common confusion between the deficit and the debt. The annual budget allocates funds for all the government programs, and if more money is going out for things like defense or education or whatever than coming in through taxes or tariffs, then you have a federal deficit, an annual deficit. And for fiscal year 2018, which starts next month, that number's expected to be $440 billion. The debt is the cumulative amount of all the money the country owes. And right now, that's close to $20 trillion. And anyone who has a U.S. savings bond owns some of that debt."", 'But what about the question of staying under budget?', ""Well, that's been an ongoing debate for many, many years. A lot of Americans want a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget, and most states do have to abide by that. But the federal government has obligations that are different from the states, like defense, and the argument is that flexibility is necessary. And again, keep in mind the deficit is different from the debt. When you compare it to a family budget, remember, most families do have debt in some form, a mortgage or a car loan. And once you've taken on that debt, you're expected to make payments on it. And that's what the federal government has to do."", ""So this gets to some of the practicality of paying the debt, and we've got a question that speaks to that. Let's listen."", 'W. MICHAEL HINCHCLIF: Hi. My name is W. Michael Hinchclif, and I am living in Reno, Nev. My question regarding the debt ceiling is this - has anyone in government considered making it a percentage of GDP or some other economic measurement instead of just a flat number?', ""Well, there have been efforts to make it automatic so you don't have this fraught debate all the time. There's this so-called Gephardt Rule, named after Dick Gephardt who was a leader in Congress, and it says when the budget is passed the debt ceiling is deemed to have been raised. But the problem is that Congress has regularly failed to approve a budget."", ""But look, it's also, Rachel, a political problem. Many members of Congress like to use the debt limit as an opportunity to rail against federal spending. Others like to use it as leverage, which is what the Democrats are doing right now. That's why they insisted on a short-term fix so they can use this must-pass legislation to attach something they want. And that's why Republicans are so upset with Trump for siding with the Democrats on this deal. They don't want it to be something where the Democrats have the ability..."", 'A bargaining chip.', 'A bargaining chip, exactly.', 'Commentator Cokie Roberts.

Host Scott Simon discusses the change with NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman.","[""So the president's domestic agenda is jobs. The national security agenda: even more complicated."", ""Since my administration took office, we have removed nearly 100,000 troops and ended our combat mission in Iraq. We've refocused on the war against al-Qaida and subjected its leadership to relentless pressure. We are pursuing a new strategy that finally devotes the resources we need in the fight against extremism in Afghanistan and Pakistan."", ""That was President Obama yesterday at the White House.

Morning, Tom."", 'Hi, Scott.', 'And did the general jump or was he pushed?', ""Well, the sense all along was that Jones would be leaving in January. So this is, of course, a bit earlier than expected. But really for more than a year now there was speculation in Washington that Jones was on the outs with the White House. He didn't fit in, didn't work long hours, and also he, more importantly, didn't have the managerial skills for this job."", 'So he was accused of being ineffective?', ""That's right. That was the general sense. And at the Pentagon, they never really knew where he stood on the issue of more troops for Afghanistan. And of course it's Afghanistan and the military strategy and the troops that will be the defining issue of this presidency."", 'a disappointment.', 'In what sense? What was Mr. Allison suggesting General Jones should have done?', ""And that left President Obama in something of a box. You either support your commander on the ground or you do not, and that's not much of a choice. So there should have been more choices on, let's say, a smaller counterinsurgency effort with fewer troops. And again, that was his responsibility as national security adviser, to offer more options."", 'Help us read the tea leaves on this, Tom.

But clearly he doesn't have a lot of military experience, and that's going to be a bit of a problem with the Pentagon."", 'Which raises the question. Reportedly, Secretary Gates has said that - he said Tom Donilon would be a disaster in the job.', ""And the next big test, of course, will come in December. There's going to be a review of the Afghan strategy. The sense is that there'll be some tweaking here. And even more important is next July. President says he wants troops to start coming home.

Early this morning, authorities in northern Michigan arrested 37-year- old Stephen Grant on charges of murder, disinterment and mutilation. On Friday Grant fled suburban Detroit and ended up driving more than 200 miles after authorities served a warrant to search the family's home. In the Grant's garage, investigators found a human torso, apparently that of Tara Lynn Grant missing since February 9th. Other body parts were found in a nearby park.

We'll tell you about Diamante Driver in just a few minutes."", ""You're watching CNN, the most trusted name in news."", 'Dueling Democrats, Senator Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama speak in Selma, 42 years after the historic Civil Rights march there. And how did a toothache lead to the death of a 12-year-old boy? Parents, you need to stick around for this story. Welcome back to THE NEWSROOM, I\'m Fredricka Whitfield. Some new video for you right now out of northern Michigan, showing the end of the manhunt for a murder suspect Stephen Grant. The pictures are a bit blurry but you can make out Grant being hoisted from the ground to a Coast Guard helicopter there in those grainy images. The 37-year-old had been on the run since Friday when police served a warrant to search his home. Officers later found a torso of Grant\'s missing wife, Terra hidden in the garage. Now to some political news. Former President Bill Clinton is being honored at a major battleground of the Civil Rights Movement. Clinton is in Selma, Alabama, where he\'s been inducted into the city\'s Voting Rights Hall of Fame. It comes during this month\'s 42nd anniversary of the bloody clash between voting rights demonstrators and police at the Edmund Pettis Bridge. With Clinton, his wife, Senator and presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, all of them to be walking over the Edmund Pettis Bridge. These live pictures you are seeing right now in a commemorative march. As we have mentioned, also in Selma today, both leading Democratic presidential candidates Senator Clinton as well as Senator Barack Obama. Obama and Clinton are going head to head in a bid to win the African-American vote. Joining us in our Washington studio to talk about all of this, John Mercurio of the National Journals ""The Hotline."" We are going to focus however John, on really what it means that the president is also now campaigning with Senator Clinton, Selma being the first place that we have now seen the former president out shaking hands, making his face known, sending a message while he campaigns with the senator. What does this mean to you?', '"" It is one of the biggest challenges that she face in this campaign, trying to convince voters that she\'s running on her own as her own political entity. I think that was one of the biggest challenges we saw in her speech this morning which was just sort of address these voters and address this African-American church that she spoke to and say look I am my own person and I\'m actually a product of the march on Selma, much as Barack Obama and Governor Bill Richardson are. I think it was a unique challenge that she faced and I think Barack Obama faces his own challenges. But the simularities between the two of them I think are what are really interesting, both of them trying to make the connection between Selma, the Selma march and their own presidential campaign.', 'You think that was fairly courageous for the senator to even mention Obama, to mention Richardson as she was making that speech, saying that they, and I, have all gained from what our civil rights forefathers did right here in Selma 42 years ago?', 'I think what she was trying to do is obviously set a specific tone. We saw a just a couple of weeks ago that the Clinton campaign and the Obama campaign were sniping with this nasty exchange over a Hollywood fundraiser. I think when you are seeing today is that we are talking about conciliation and we are talking about civil rights and we are talking about the ability to sort of cross racial divides and get along. Not necessarily racial divides but political divides. What she was trying to do and what I think Senator Obama is trying to do is to sort of, you know, extend that olive branch, if you will, and especially in a place of worship to sort of you know, pay tribute to his campaign and her campaign.', 'Was this a different Senator Clinton than what we have seen?', ""I think to some extent it was. Obviously, any time any politician speaks in a black church, there's a certain challenge that they face. Barack Obama rose to that challenge he is a very gifted orator. Hillary Clinton has a lot of talent, maybe speaking publicly may not be one of the top talents that she has. I think she was giving it a little bit more firepower, fire and brimstone she may usually give. I think to some extent it worked."", ""We didn't see President Clinton in the church with Senator Clinton but we know that he was in town and he is being inducted into the Voting Rights Hall of Fame. What do you make of this strategy, bringing out the big guns now, so early on into the race as opposed to waiting, allowing Senator Clinton to continue to establish herself before bringing out her husband?"", 'Well, I talked to some Clinton campaign advisers over the weekend and I think what it really came down to is this is just an event that Former President Clinton was not going to be able to miss. It would have been, I think, a larger debate within the political community if Senator Clinton had appeared alone and not with her husband. Her husband is that bridge to the African-American community. It is why she still has very, very strong support in that community. It is because of all the work that her husband did in Arkansas and as president in the White House. So I think for him to have missed this event would have stuck out more, I think, than the idea of bringing him along.', ""While we are talking about that, we are receiving, John, new pictures now showing Senator Obama and showing President Clinton and Senator Clinton all kind of, you know, alongside one another in the crowd there. We know historically that President Clinton has done very well in the African-American vote. Many African- Americans have really embraced him throughout his presidency and thereafter. So while President Clinton or while Senator Clinton may want to enjoy that kind of popularity her husband brings, at the same time everyone knows African-Americans don't vote as one monolith, nor do they, nor do women vote as a monolith either. Are you going to see that Senator Clinton might try to reshape her campaign so that she can appeal to both, which are vital in the voting public?"", 'Well, I think what you saw this morning and in the speech that she gave was that she was trying to say look, the march on Selma and the entire Civil Rights Movement was about more than African-Americans. It was about she said if you follow the logic and the sort of meaning of the Civil Rights Movement it was about Hispanics being able to advance politically and it was about women being able to advance politically. Women of all race. So I think what she was trying to do in the speech and, you know in this entire event, this entire visit is to say that she much like Obama is part and a beneficiary of the Civil Rights Movement.', 'John Mercurio, thanks so much for your time.', 'Thank you.', ""And of course coming up in THE NEWSROOM we are going to talk more about Senators Clinton and Obama. Very similar messages coming from Selma, but their style very different as well. Joining us will be a Democratic strategist, Morris Reid. Well imagine this a child dying because of a lack of dental care. What seems so improbable became all too real for a 12-year-old boy just last week. But as CNN's Gary Nurenberg reports the pitfalls of substandard or inaccessible dental care confronts millions of American kids every year."", 'At the end, 12-year-old Dimonte Driver may have known he was dying.', 'His last words to me was mom, make sure you pray for me.', ""Dimonte did not complain enough. He had a toothache, but he didn't tell anybody about it."", ""He knew his mom couldn't find a dentist to treat his younger brothers six abscessed teeth."", 'The bureaucracy involved in treating Medicaid patients is so extreme that a lot of doctors just decide not to treat and Medicaid patients at all.', ""All he had to do was what kind of insurance you have, no, we don't take that."", 'Dimonte began to feel worse and did say something.', 'He was complaining of headaches.', 'So it was a doctor not a dentist that saw him first.', 'They thought it was a sinus infection. Three days later he started vomiting. At that point they did a cat scan and a spinal tap and they found the raging infection.', 'A surgeon said it was not just in his tooth.', 'They said he has to have surgery; he has pus on his brain.', 'Dimonte died from the tooth infection that spread to his brain.', 'You must learn from this appalling failure of our broken health care system and fix it.', ""Within days of Dimonte's death, Congress was considering legislation providing $40 million in dental services to the poor, the state legislature in Annapolis is also considering additional funding to make dental care more accessible to indigent children."", 'It is an epidemic disease and it is preventable. We know how to prevent it if we can get those kids in the office.', ""Rawson says states that have trimmed Medicaid red tapes seen more dentists accepting the insurance and more patients using it. That kind of reform may be Dimonte's legacy."", 'This was not necessary and it can be fixed.', ""The family's lawyer Laurie Norris says that among the solutions here are more and better dental hygiene programs in public schools. Having pediatricians do dental screenings when they see kids and in Maryland's case rewriting laws that prevent dental hygienists from providing dental care unless they are under strict supervision of a dentist."", 'All right. Gary Nurenberg thank you so much. As we mentioned, this is a historic day in Selma, Alabama, 42 years after demonstrators and police clashed there at the Edmund Pettis Bridge in Selma. Now you see hundreds, if not thousands of people retracing the steps of Civil Rights leaders in the crowd there, some members of what some might call the old guard, civil rights leaders who were there 42 years ago. Rev. Joseph Lowry, Congressman John Lewis and also among the crowd many who have applauded those civil rights leaders saying that their gains have come about as a result of among them President Bill Clinton, Former President Bill Clinton, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton a leading Democratic contender as well Senator Obama the other leading the Democratic contender. Both of them took to the polls of today to spread their messages, talking about how they have stood on the shoulders of civil rights leaders who were there that bloody Sunday 42 years ago. Today making history of another sort. Our Mary Snow is in the crowd and she will be joining us later on in THE NEWSROOM. Mean time, police return dog-napped Yorkie to their families. Their saga coming up.', 'Marching together in Selma, Alabama 42 years after what has been known as bloody Sunday. The violent clash between demonstrators and the police in Selma, 1942. Well, today, it\'s a scene of unity, especially as there are two leading Democratic presidential hopefuls among the crowd. Live pictures right now. One of the reasons why Former President Clinton is in town. Not just to be alongside his Democratic presidential hopeful wife, Senator Clinton. But because he\'s being inducted into the Voting Rights Hall of Fame, you are looking at live pictures right now of that ceremony-taking place in Selma. That is what is taking place stateside. Mean time across the seas in Iraq, an al Qaeda linked group posts a grizzly video online. The video showed 18 Iraqi security guards blindfolded in a room. The last part shows them kneeling in a field being shot execution style. CNN has not been able to verify the authenticity of the video but it is posted on Websites that often carry the group\'s messages and videos. In central Baghdad, the U.S. military reports of roadside bomb exploded Saturday, killing three American soldiers the soldiers\' units and names have not been released. Civilians again caught in the crossfire in Afghanistan. It happened after a suicide attacker and gunman targeted the coalition convoy wounding one soldier. Afghan authorities and witnesses say emotional American troops, and then shot indiscriminately killing the civilians. A U.S. spokesman says the deaths were ""A result of the Taliban extremists cowardly act."" The incident is under investigation; hundreds of angry Afghans protested the shooting, throwing rocks at the police and blocking the roads. Two British soldiers have been killed in southern Afghanistan. The British defense ministry says they died in a rocket attack yesterday. And here\'s true puppy love. Back home after being stolen and stuffed in a sack. More in THE NEWSROOM.', ""A happy conclusion to a bold crime. We love good news when it happens. You are looking at pictures of a home invasion robbery. All that caught on tape. Thanks to the video, four stolen puppies are back in the arms of their owners. But Saray Fadell (ph) with CNN's Los Angeles affiliate KCOW says police still need your help."", 'It is a reunion Kelly Lee and her family has waited for. They never imagined they would see their little puppies again, the dog breeders held back tears as Los Angeles police handed them 3-year-old Tanja and the other Yorkshire terriers.', 'I want to thank you. I just want to thank you.', 'These adorable Yorkies were stolen from their home in Korea town eight days ago two men responded to an ad and robbed the family at gunpoint. Snatching the puppies in garbage bags. Survelience cameras captured the home invasion, police tell us the video ultimately led to an arrest. Hundreds of tips came in from around the country.', 'With the cooperation of this individual and his father, we were able to recover the four dogs.', 'It took officers more than 12 hours to find all four dogs. The suspects apparently gave them away as gifts to friends in various cities.', 'My personal feeling is after he realized it was something stupid and to his credit his father was able to convince them to turn himself in.', 'But take a good look at the gunman in the video. Tonight police need your help in finding the second suspect in this robbery.', ""We know him as Troy or T.C. and if he's watching this, it's in his best interest to turn himself in."", 'The police say one puppy valued at $2,500.00 is still missing. What in the world is this? This is a story you will not believe. It actually happened, apparently two brothers, one 2 years old and the other 5, are supposedly smoking marijuana there. Allegedly given to them by their 17-year-old uncle and his 18-year-old friend. Both of who are now facing charges.', 'I have never seen anything like this, it is quite so disturbing. And children are counting on us to protect them. These individuals did everything but protect those children they have scarred them and it is absolutely horrific.', 'Disturbing to say the least. The police chief Bruce Ure says both the children have been turned over, rather, to child protective services. A Michigan couple got the shock of their lives in two bubble wrapped packages. This is pretty gross, inside a human liver and part of a head. The items are medical specimens from China. They were mistakenly delivered by DHL. The company is red faced about the incident and released the following statement saying, ""DHL is currently investigating the facts behind a recent shipment of medical specimens destined for a laboratory facility in Michigan."" Also straight-ahead in THE NEWSROOM more of what\'s taking place in Selma. On one side of your screen, you are seeing the induction ceremony, President Bill Clinton being inducted into the Voting Rights Hall of Fame. And then on the other side of your screen, you are seeing marcher\'s kind of reliving the steps of Civil Rights giants from 42 years ago who took part in bloody Sunday. It was to be a peaceful demonstration of civil rights activists but it turned into a bloody one because of the clashes with police. We will take you to Selma coming up.', ""I'm CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider with a look at your cold and flu report for Sunday. As we check out the map you will find much of the country reporting widespread activity. Especially from the northern tier through Texas, in the center of the nation. Otherwise, regional or local activity reported. Pretty much for the entire U.S. That's a look at your cold and flu report for Sunday. I'm meteorologist Bonnie Schneider."", 'It is the gift that keeps on giving. Today it is giving Senator Obama the chance to run for president of the United States.', ""I'm here because you all sacrificed for me."", ""Next in THE NEWSROOM a legendary civil rights battlefield now the site a fight for African American votes.

CNN-116028,THE SITUATION ROOM,2007-4-11,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0704/11/sitroom.01.html,,Duke Lacrosse Players Charges Dropped,"[""-- doesn't make any sense to any one at all. I believe you can do both. End the policy and provide for the safe redeployment of our forces on the ground there."", ""Senator Dodd we have to leave it there, we'll listen to your speech tonight in Iowa. Thanks very much for coming in."", 'Thank you Wolf.', ""And to our viewers, you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Happening now, a shocking conclusion to the sexual assault case against three Duke University lacrosse players, why prosecutors now say the athletes were innocent victims of a rush to accuse. A longer haul in Iraq. Active duty U.S. Army soldiers getting extended tours of duty as the U.S. military says Iran is killing American troops. And presidential contenders clash over the war. John McCain says Democrats are being reckless, Barack Obama says McCain is fantasizing. I'll speak with the senator from Illinois. I'm Wolf Blitzer, you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. A truly stunning end to a case that made headlines and sparked controversy, North Carolina's attorney general announcing he's dropping all charges against three Duke University lacrosse players accused of assaulting an exotic dancer. And within the last hour, those players spoke out in an emotional news conference. Take a listen."", 'These allegations are false, these charges were false and should never have been brought. We fully cooperated from the beginning. There was never a blue wall of silence. Look at the facts of the case and you will see that.', 'At points it was tough to see the light and even imagine a day without this weight on our shoulders. Knowing I had the truth on my side was really the most comforting thing of all throughout the past year.', ""Let's go straight to CNN's Jason Carroll in Raleigh, CNN's legal analyst Jeff Toobin, he's in New York. What do we expect, Jason, to hear now from the accuser?"", ""Well we've actually already reached out to the accuser and her family, and her family obviously now says that they're extremely disappointed by what the attorney general said. They're also angry at the attorney general insinuating in some way shape or form that this young woman is mentally distraught in some way. So they are angry about that. You even heard the attorney general at one point Wolf say that this young woman wanted to pursue charges, and that those thoughts have not changed from her point of view."", ""Other evidence contradicts her story. She contradicts herself. Next week, we'll be providing a written summary of the important factual findings and some of the specific contradictions that have led us to the conclusion that no attack occurred."", ""I want to go to our legal analyst, bring in Jeff Toobin. It's pretty extraordinary, Jeff, when you think about it, the way this case unraveled, and what we learned today."", ""Just, really, almost unprecedented in my experience, because, what the attorney general said was not simply that there wasn't enough evidence to proceed. He said, based on the investigation that his office had done, these three young men were innocent. Period. And that's something prosecutors almost never say, and that just shows the magnitude of the vindication they got today."", 'The prosecutor who was dumped from this case, Jason, what happens to him now?', ""Well, a couple of things are going to happen. At this point, at this point right now, Michael NiFong, the Durham district attorney who used to be charged with this case is being investigated by the state bar for ethics violations. He's being charged with withholding exculpatory evidence, for mishandling the case. A hearing on that is set to happen this Friday. Defense sources tell me Wolf that they plan to pursue civil charges against Michael NiFong, possibly against Duke University, but they also tell me that they will probably not seek those types of civil charges against the accuser in this case. They refer to her as a troubled young woman and they just don't see the point in doing that."", 'Any reaction from the university yet, Jason?', ""We are awaiting reaction from the university. They're in the process of formulating some sort of a response. But I have to tell you, just from listening to some of the players, and hearing from the players and their families and the defense attorneys, over a period of time Wolf, they are very disappointed in the way that Duke University handled this."", ""I want to play for our viewer's part of the statement that Reade Seligmann read at this news conference. Listen to this."", ""This entire experience has opened up my eyes up to a tragic world of injustice I never knew existed. If police officers and a district attorney can systematically railroad us with absolutely no evidence whatsoever, I can't imagine what they'd do to people who do not have the resources to defend themselves."", 'Toobin, is this an isolated case of a district attorney run amuck, if you will, or does this kind of stuff go on all the time around the country?', ""Well, it does go on. I wouldn't say it goes on all the time. And I was very moved by what Reade Seligmann said right there because that's certainly what occurred to me. These folks are upper middle class kids who hired the best attorneys in North Carolina, who did a fantastic job for them. But there are innocent people in prison in this country, and they don't all have those kinds of resources, and it's just our job as journalists and lawyers and citizens, to limit that as much as possible. But he's right. I mean this does go on and it is chilling to think about what people without these sort of resources can do about it."", 'Stand by guys for a moment. We are now getting a statement in from the university, Abbi Tatton is picking it up online. What are you getting Abbi?', ""Wolf, it's just been posted in the last couple of minutes, a statement from Duke University President Richard Broadhead. What he's saying is that he welcomes that these remaining charges against the three men have been dropped, he goes on to say that this was an extraordinarily painful year for those three young men and their families. Broadhead saying from the outset, I have been careful to note that these students were entitled to the presumption of innocence and I looked to the legal system to determine the merit of the charges. What Broadhead is saying today, this is the Duke University president, is that he hopes this starts a new day for all those involved. Wolf?"", ""A stunning development today in North Carolina. Abbi thank you very much for that, we'll have more on this story coming up. But there's been another important development today, it involves the war in Iraq. Hard pressed to find enough troops to fight two wars, the Pentagon is now ordering U.S. Army soldiers to stay longer in the combat zones. Let's go live to our senior Pentagon correspondent Jamie McIntyre. It's going to be a long haul for a lot of U.S. soldiers, Jamie. Tell our viewers what happened today."", ""That's right Wolf. The long war has gotten a lot longer for about 125,000 U.S. soldiers in a combat zone, as well as an equal number of replacements who will be replacing them in the months ahead."", 'The enduring wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are now requiring even more sacrifice by active duty American soldiers. The Pentagon has approved a plan to increase the standard tour of duty for the active army in both combat zones from 12 months to 15. Without that plan, Defense Secretary Robert Gates would be forced to deploy five brigades to Iraq early, and extend other brigades on short notice in the coming months.', 'I strongly believe that we owe our troops as much advance notice as possible, and clarity on what they and their families can expect. In other words, predictability.', 'The three-month extension applies to all active duty army soldiers deployed in the U.S. Central Command area. That includes over 100,000 army soldiers of the 145,000 U.S. troops currently in Iraq, and about 20,000 soldiers of the 47,000 NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan. While the active duty troops will deploy for 15 months, they would get 12 months at home. Guard and reserve troops would still serve a year on and get five years at home, as Secretary Robert Gates promised back in January. And most Marines whose deployments are tied to Navy ship movements, will still serve seven month tours with a six-month break. The army says the extensions were the best way to provide the 20 combat brigades U.S. commanders say are needed to maintain the Baghdad security plan known as the surge for at least a year.', ""This decision today does not predict when this surge will end. What it does is it allows us to provide to the nation, if needed, the amount of force that's currently deployed for a sustained period of time."", 'U.S. commanders say despite the discouraging news about longer deployments, that U.S. military morale remains high, and that the army while stretched is not broken. As evidence, they point to the latest recruiting figures and retention figures that show the active duty army exceeded its goal both for signing up new soldiers and reenlisting old ones. Wolf?', ""Jamie McIntyre reporting, thanks Jamie. Meanwhile, there was a very close call today off the coast of Israel. An American airliner was intercepted by fighter jets over the Mediterranean, and the alert reached the highest levels of the Israeli military. Let's go to CNN's Kathleen Koch, she's been monitoring this. How close of a call was this Kathleen?"", 'Well Wolf, there were some very, very harrowing moments today for the 251 passengers on board Continental flight 90 as they were some 40 miles off the coast of Israel. Four Israeli Air Force combat jets intercepted what they were told was an unidentified aircraft entering Israeli airspace. A military spokesman says it, quote, ""Did not properly contact Israeli authorities."" Now, Continental has a different story. Airline spokesman Dave Messing saying that as the plane was heading to Tel Aviv from Newark, New Jersey. There was a temporary loss of communication between the aircraft and air traffic control as it was being transferred from one sector to another. Messing says no one knows why communications broke down, but they\'re certainly going to find out. Wolf?', 'So what happens next Kathleen?', 'Wolf, the airline insists that the Continental pilot did the right thing, made all the necessary contacts according to normal arrival procedures. Quote, ""Why the local authorities reacted the way they did needs to be looked at more thoroughly in Israel"", according to Continental spokesman Messing. And he added quote, ""I don\'t think anyone thinks they were close to pulling the trigger."" As for the Israelis, the military spokesman says that the Continental pilot only contacted aviation authorities after the aircraft was intercepted by Israeli jets and identified ad a civilian passenger plane. It was escorted to the ground around 4:30 this afternoon. Everything\'s fine, the passengers deplaned normally. Israeli Defense Forces, the chief of staff there, was notified as this incident was playing out, so, everyone\'s taking this seriously. A joint inquiry has been launched by Israeli aviation and military authorities. And Continental for its part plans to review the incident to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again. Wolf?', 'All right. A close call, but fortunately it didn\'t end in disaster. Thanks very much Kathleen Koch reporting. Jack Cafferty is in New York with ""The Cafferty File."" Jack?', 'There\'s a job opening in the administration, and there don\'t seem to be any takers. The White House looking for a high powered war czar to oversee operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This person would report directly to President Bush, of course, and the National Security Advisor and would coordinate policy between agencies like the Pentagon and the State Department. Just what we need, right? Another layer of bureaucracy to mismanage the mess that is the war in Iraq. The Pentagon, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the secretaries of all the various service branches, that\'s not enough. We need a war czar. Well so far, three retired four-star generals have said no thank you. One of them, retired Marine General Jack Sheehan told the ""Washington Post,"" quote, ""The very fundamental issue is, they don\'t know where the hell they\'re going. So rather than go over there, develop an ulcer and eventually leave, I said, ""No, thanks."" I love the marines. Sheehan said Vice President Cheney holds more sway in the administration than those who are looking for a way out of Iraq. A White House spokeswoman says the administration is considering a wide range of options but she said there\'s no job description as yet. Here\'s the question, ""What does it mean if the White House cannot find anyone willing to take the job of ""war czar."" E-mail us at caffertyfile@cnn.com or go to cnn.com/caffertyfile. Wolf?', 'You like that title, ""war czar,"" Jack?', 'It just boggles my mind. What are they doing?', 'What a title. All right, Jack, thanks very much.

Live with the candidates, the analysts and the best political team on television on this AMERICAN MORNING. And good morning to you, it is Monday, June the 4th, the day after the Democratic debate. I'm John Roberts broadcasting live from Manchester, New Hampshire this morning. Good morning to you, Kiran."", ""Good to see you. Wow, what an interesting debate last night. I'm Kiran Chetry here in New York. A lot of fireworks, pretty interesting last night."", ""Yeah, I really liked the amount of interplay that there was between the candidates. I think it really served to illuminate some different things about them, got them off the talking points a little bit, which is very important. Of course we're going to be covering the debate and where the campaign goes from here all morning. Also on our radar this morning though, and this is really important stuff, new video today, Paris Hilton reports to jail overnight. Earlier in the night Paris attended the MTV music awards and talked about her pending lockup."", ""I am trying to be strong right now. I'm definitely scared but I'm ready to face my sentence and even though this is a really hard time I have my friends and family and my fans who support me and it's just been really helpful in this really scary time."", ""And some how you know Kiran, she's just going to convert this into good publicity."", ""Of course. She is the master at it. It's funny though because we're talking about the big debate, but also this was the most popular on cnn.com of the stories so we're going to have a little more on that. Also, the remnants of tropical storm Barry bringing much-needed rain to Florida dousing some, not all of the wildfires there but it also meant some scary moments for one particular family. We're going to hear from a boy in a moment. Check this out that is the bedroom where he and his little sister were sleeping when a tree collapsed on their home. There you see the shot outside. It was his quick thinking that saved his little sister's life. We're going to have much more on that story. And also check in with Chad Myers about the remnants of Barry now moving up the east coast."", ""Arriving here in New Hampshire this morning. President Bush leaves for Europe and the G-8 summit in an hour's time. Police have tightened checks around the summit site near the port of Rootstock, Germany. On Saturday 128 protesters were arrested and more than a thousand police were hurt, in a huge clash. More protests are expected before the G-8 summit begins on Wednesday. Russian President Vladimir Putin mouthing off before he heads to the summit with a threat to point his missiles at Europe again. He says that he would retarget weapons if the United States goes ahead with the European missile shield. U.S. Russian tensions are at a post Cold War high."", 'Iran\'s top security official says that plans to build a missile shield in Europe are a joke. That Iran\'s missiles can\'t reach Europe. Iran\'s president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is calling Israel quote, ""A corrupt occupier regime that will soon be destroyed."" He says the Lebanese and Palestinians will bring about that destruction. Meantime, Ahmadinejad is set to meet with Daniel Ortega, the president of Nicaragua. Ahmadinejad visited Ortega in Nicaragua just a few months ago. Ortega\'s first stop will be Libya, as he is making the trip on a jet that was lent to him by Moammar Gadhafi. Well the U.S. military in Iraq announcing a bloody start to the month of June, 15 soldiers killed in the first three days of the month, including four killed by a bomb during a search in Baghdad yesterday. A roadside bomb also killed three Iraqis in Baghdad today. Defense Secretary Robert Gates says the U.S. and NATO forces are making progress against the Taliban in Afghanistan. Despite a recent rise in violence there, Gates said that things are slowly cautiously headed in the right direction. Gates is on his second trip to Afghanistan since becoming defense secretary back in December. Violence in Lebanon spreading this morning, moving now to a second refugee camp. Two Lebanese soldiers were killed in the new fight in southern Lebanon. Thousands of troops are battling militants linked to al Qaeda that are holed up in a Palestinian refugee camp in the north. Fighting there is now in its third week. More than 100 people have died.', ""There were no major gaffes or surprises in last night's Democratic debate here in New Hampshire. The candidates did spar with each other on Iraq which dominated the debate, with John Edwards getting particularly feisty. Our senior political correspondent Candy Crowley has the play-by-play from the Sullivan Arena."", 'Consistently third in national polls, John Edwards took it to them Sunday night, commending his two closest rivals for voting against an Iraq spending bill, blasting them for failing to lead on the issue.', 'They went quietly to the floor of the Senate, cast the right vote but there is a difference between leadership and legislate.', 'It produced the first dust-up of the evening as Obama took exception.', ""And I think John, the fact is, is that I opposed this war from the start. So you are about 4 1/2 years late on leadership on this issue. And, you know, I think it's important not to play politics on something that is as critical and as difficult as this."", 'This is a battle for the fiercely anti-war base, candidates vying to see who can end the war first. It was Dennis Kucinich who spoke in perfect pitch.', ""This war belongs to the Democratic Party because the Democrats were put in charge by the people on the last election with the thought that they were going to end the war. Well they haven't."", ""Perched at the top of the pack, Clinton's debate mission was to be front runner, stay above the fray. She had her sights set on the general election, not her Democratic colleagues."", ""The differences among us are minor. The differences between us and the Republicans are major and I don't want anybody in America to be confused."", 'Clinton and Edwards clashed only gently when he repeated his assertion that the war on terror is nothing more than a bumper sticker.', ""That's exactly what it is, it's a bumper sticker."", 'She politely dissented.', 'I have seen firsthand the terrible damage that can be inflicted on our country by a small band of terrorists and I believe we are safer than we were. We are not yet safe enough.', 'On other issues of foreign policy the group touched on Iran and Pakistan but genocide in Darfur provoked a lengthy conversation and passionate response.', ""I went there, I sat on the borders, I went into those camps. They're going to have thousands and thousands and thousands of people die. We've got to stop talking and act."", 'Healthcare, education and taxes tonight covered the gamut, but time and again it was the war that dominated discussion as it has the campaign. Candy Crowley, CNN, Manchester, New Hampshire.', ""In just a few minutes we'll be speaking with one of the Democratic hopefuls, New Mexico governor Bill Richardson is going to join us. Tomorrow night the Republicans get their chance to debate. CNN's Wolf Blitzer moderates beginning at 7:00 p.m. eastern and Wolf will be joining us in our third hour of AMERICAN MORNING, to talk more about what happened last night, and what it means for the future. Kiran?"", ""All right John. Well turning now to the alleged terror plot uncovered this weekend against Kennedy Airport. We're learning this morning that it was a drug dealer turned informant who led investigators to four Muslim men. Investigators say the suspects have links to an extremist group in Trinidad. CNN's Jim Acosta is here now with more on this. What are you hearing about just how close they came to being able to carry this off?"", ""Well they weren't able to acquire any explosives, so that's the good news. But they did get further than other plots that we've seen in the past. Investigators say the lone U.S. citizen in the group, Russell Defreitas, traveled back and forth from New York to Guyana and Trinidad to plan the airport attack. And while authorities say the plot never got past the planning stage it highlighted a little-known terrorism threat that may be brewing in the Caribbean."", ""Suspects Abdul Kadir, Russell Defreitas, Kareem Ibrahim and Abdel Nur are described by relatives and friends as incapable of carrying out an attack on Newark's JFK Airport. While Defreitas is identified by a law enforcement source as the plot's ringleader, a friend says he had been on welfare and is more than an ordinary braggart."", 'I would say on a scale of one to 10, yes, he may be a seven or eight, you know.', 'The wife of suspect Abdul Kadir, a one time politician in the South American nation of Guyana, says her husband is a devoted father and grandfather.', 'No way at no time we were ever involved in anything of plots of bombing or any plots against America.', ""But authorities paint a dramatically different picture, pointing to the plots' alleged connections from New York to the Caribbean and South America. Defreitas worked as a cargo handler at JFK in 1995. He's a U.S. citizen originally from Guyana. Two other suspects are from the island of Trinidad. One of them still being sought by authorities. According to investigators, the suspects met in Trinidad to discuss their plans with members of a radical Muslim group called the Jamaat al Muslim. Also known as J.A.M., the extremist organization launched an unsuccessful coup in Trinidad in 1990, leaving 24 people dead. New York police commissioner Ray Kelly says the JFK plot shows just how far radical Islam has spread around the world."", 'It is different in that it has ties to the Caribbean and this is an area in which we have growing concern and I think requires a lot more focus.', ""And Russell Defreitas is due back in court for a bail hearing on Wednesday. Two of the other suspects are in Trinidad awaiting extradition hearings and we're hearing this morning that that hearing will happen this morning at 9:00."", ""All right, we'll follow that. Also we heard Commissioner Kelly talk about this new focus of radical Islam as it relates to the Caribbean. Are we doing anything differently in terms of the federal government to try to crack down on that?"", ""I don't think a lot of people knew about this threat but it is now on the radar screen of federal authorities. And I think they were actually surprised as to how deep and insidious this new threat may be in that part of the world. But so far at this point they have one person still at large in this plot so I would imagine that there are some federal authorities down there aiding in that search. And it will be interesting to see how this thing develops. We might see more faces, more plots, more threats being discussed in terms of, you know, what we can find in that region. Is there something that we should be looking at with a greater focus?"", 'All right, Jim Acosta, thanks so much. John?', ""Eleven minutes after the hour now. A war crimes trial begins without the defendant. Your quick hits now, former president of Liberia Charles Taylor refused to show at The Hague today. His attorney says that he's not going to get a fair trial. Taylor is accused of orchestrating 50,000 deaths during Sierra Leone's civil war. New charges expected today against a driver suspected of mowing down 40 people at a festival on Saturday in the nation's capital. The police chief says the driver had been smoking crack cocaine all day before getting behind the wheel. She is charged with aggravated assault while armed. First the red carpet then off to jail. Paris Hilton is already behind bars this morning.

You\'d need a raise to buy it. Still not enough? Well, there\'s also a ""Hello Kitty"" computer mouse and a ""Hello Kitty"" mousepad to complete the ensemble.', 'Let me see you come in with that.', ""All the different uses that I've found over my 5 1/2 years of using Tupperware. Because someone's going to look at a bowl and say, it's a bowl. Why do I need that? I got to show them."", ""OK, that's a little..."", 'A little frightening.', 'Well, in the history of theater, this may be the first show about Tupperware. The star of this one woman show is Dixie Longate, who is in real life a cross-dressing man and one of the top Tupperware salespersons in the', ""Really? Well, the off Broadway production is also a real Tupperware party. All of this fantastic plastic is for sale after the show. Yes, wouldn't you imagine?"", 'Would that be fun.', ""I don't know."", 'OK.', 'News of the weird.', ""Yes. All right. And coming up here in 30 minutes, latest on developing story this morning. How could a tear in the shuttle's thermal blanket affect its mission? We'll bring you the details there."", 'But first, HOUSECALL with Dr. Sanjay Gupta, that starts right now.', ""Thanks, guys. This is HOUSECALL and we've got a lot of news for you this morning. So let's get right to it. Two debates brought lots of opinion about fixing our straining healthcare system. I want you to hear straight from the candidates. Then we talk costs versus reality. Then troubling findings about a popular diabetes drug. Later, one of the biggest health concerns for men. What you need to know about it as you age. First up, though, healthcare may be one of the most important domestic issues facing the men and women that would be president. In a recent poll by CNN and the Opinion Research Corporation, 78 percent said healthcare was very or extremely important in their vote for president. With good reason. Costs are staggering. And millions have no access to basic healthcare. Here now, a look at how the presidential candidates are trying to tackle these issues."", ""Overcrowded emergency rooms, sky rocketing costs, millions of Americans with no insurance. It's a healthcare system in crisis."", 'We pay the most. And we get the least of any other industrialized nation.', 'Groups like the National Institute for Patient Rights want a less fragmented healthcare system. Presidential candidates in both parties are writing their own prescriptions.', ""This country's healthcare system is completely dysfunctional."", ""John Edwards' plan requires employers to help finance their workers' insurance and creates tax credits for the poor. Hillary Clinton's plan is similar, but she also wants insurance companies to cover preventative care, to help drive down premiums. She's also targeting chronic illness, beefing up programs already in place."", 'From my perspective, we have to lower costs, improve quality, and cover everybody.', 'Barack Obama is promising healthcare for everyone, paid for by federal and private money.', ""My belief is that most families want healthcare, but they can't afford it."", 'That echoes what a Republican, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, started in his home state last year.', ""We're going to have insurance for all of our citizens they can afford, that's theirs, that's portable."", 'Former Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson is emphasizing prevention and creating a state by state pool of coverage for those with no insurance.', ""We've got to completely transform the healthcare system, make it a wellness system, and make it a prevention system."", ""Nearly all candidates' plans have three themes."", 'How do we go about lowering costs? How do we go about improving the quality of healthcare? And finally, how do we expand access to make affordable insurance available to all?', ""No small task. That's for sure. 45 million people lack health insurance in this country. And voters like you are demanding answers from candidates about what they plan on doing. Now in case you didn't get a chance to watch the debates, I wanted to boil it down and bring you the plans in their own words. We start with the Democrats."", ""This country's healthcare system is completely dysfunctional. I'm proud of the fact that I was the first person to come out with a specific, truly universal healthcare plan. I'd pay for it by getting rid of Bush's tax cuts for people who make over $200,000 a year. And I believe you cannot cover everybody in America, create a more efficient healthcare system, cover the cracks, you know, getting rid of things like preexisting conditions, and making sure that mental health is treated the same as physical health -- I don't think you can do all those things for nothing. That's not the truth."", ""My belief is that most families want healthcare, but they can't afford it. And so my emphasis is on driving down the costs, taking on the insurance companies, making sure that they are limited in the ability to extract profits and deny coverage, that we make sure the drug companies have to do what's right by their patients instead of simply hording their profits."", ""We have to lower costs, improve quality, and cover everybody. What's important and what I learned in the previous effort is you've got to have the political will, a broad coalition of business and labor, doctors, nurses, hospitals, everybody standing firm when the inevitable attacks come from the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical companies that don't want to change the system."", 'My plan is mandatory. You do have everybody sharing -- the employer, the employee. You have the state and the federal government. Secondly, I believe that we can have a plan where, if you were satisfied with your healthcare plan, you can keep it. No new bureaucracies. But in addition to that, you focus on prevention.', ""All the savings that Senator Clinton just talked about are in my plan. And they're in Senator Obama's plan. And both of us have recognized that it's going to cost significant money. And we've talked about how we're going to pay for it."", ""What Senator Clinton, Senator Edwards, Senator Obama are talking about, they're talking about letting the insurance companies stay in charge. They're talking about continuing a for profit healthcare system. And I think we need a president who's ready to challenge that. And I'm ready to challenge the insurance companies."", 'All right, lots of ideas there, as you could hear. But a lot of things in common as well. Working with individuals, working with businesses, and getting some federal government involvement. Now not long after the Democrats talked about healthcare, the Republican presidential candidates weighed in as well.', ""The problem with our health insurance is, it's government and employer dominated. People don't make individual choices. It's your health. You should own your health insurance. We should be giving you a major tax deduction, $15,000 for a family, so you can buy your own health insurance. If you buy health insurance for $8,000 or $9,000, you'll save $5,000 or $6,000 in tax free money. Then we should have a health savings account in which you could put some money aside to pay for your ordinary medical expenses. And the reality is that we need a free market. We need 100 million Americans making different decisions that will bring down the cost of health insurance. It will bring down the cost of prescription medicine. Free market principles are the only things that reduce costs and improve quality. Socialized medicine will ruin medicine in the United States."", ""Number one, we spend $2 trillion on healthcare. That's 60 percent of the gross national product. 93 percent of the costs of healthcare goes into waiting until after you become sick. Only 7 percent of the money is used to keep you well in the first place. We've got to completely transform the healthcare system, make it a wellness system, and make it a prevention system. Secondly, we have 125 million Americans that have one or more chronic illnesses. In order to change this, we have to educate the American people about tobacco, about diabetes, about cardiovascular, and about obesity. You do that, you'll be able to change healthcare. The third thing, 25 percent of Americans use two-thirds of the cost of healthcare. If you manage those diseases, you can reduce that down to 50 percent and save lots of money."", ""This is a big issue for this country. Every Democrat out there is talking about a form of socialized medicine, government takeover, massive tax increase. We have to stand up and not just talk about it. I'm the guy who actually tackled this issue. We get all of our citizens insured. We get people that were uninsured with private health insurance. We have to stand up and say the market works. Personal responsibility works. We're going to have insurance for all of our citizens they can afford, that's theirs, that's portable. They never have to worry about losing it. That's the answer."", ""Here's what we have to do. We need to be able to buy our healthcare insurance across state lines, Wolf. Right now, the same single policy that can be purchased in Long Beach for $73 costs $334 in New Jersey. The states lock up the insurance industry. They won't let Americans buy across state lines, just like they do everything else. If we're able to do that, we're going to bring down the cost."", ""All right, so we've heard from the Republicans and the Democrats on healthcare, but did any of them stand out as front runners on this particular issue? Not long ago, we caught up with senior political analyst Bill Schneider in Manchester, New Hampshire. He knows this better than anybody. I started by asking him why healthcare is becoming a political issue now after being off the radar for more than a decade."", ""The healthcare issue was very hot in the early 1990s because the economy was poor and people were afraid, if they lost their jobs, they'd lose their healthcare. Now it's a different concern. Two things really. One is escalating costs. Healthcare costs have been rising rapidly. People's health insurance premiums have gone up very sharply. And they're afraid not of losing their jobs so much as losing their healthcare because they can't afford to pay for it. Employers have been cutting back. And second of all, the rapidly rising number of uninsured Americans. I think it's now above 45 million Americans, approaching 50 million, who don't have any health insurance, which, of course, costs everybody. And people know that. So those two concerns, cost and the number of uninsured, is really driving that issue."", 'All right. So when you take all that, Bill, did anyone stand out among the crowd on this particular issue?', ""In the Democratic debate, there was an interesting discussion between John Edwards and Barack Obama over whose plan was truly universal. Edwards claimed his was, because he mandated that everyone buy health insurance in his plan, just like everyone is required in many states to buy auto insurance. But Barack Obama pointed out, well, you can mandate all you want, but if people can't afford it, they're not going to buy it. And he said his plan makes healthcare more affordable, health insurance more affordable. And then Hillary Clinton came in and talked from the voice of experience about how they all have to work together. It was an interesting debate. On the Republican side, most candidates didn't really have a plan, but they attacked the Democrats for offering what they called socialized medicine. The candidate with the most experience was Tommy Thompson. After all, he used to be Secretary of Health and Human Services. He talked very knowledgeably about some of the reforms that are need to make healthcare more affordable. And then Mitt Romney spoke up about what he did in Massachusetts to really mandate healthcare coverage for every citizen in Massachusetts. That could be a problem for him because other Republican competitors are saying that was big government, a plan that was also supported by Ted Kennedy."", ""Ted Kennedy there and not someone that most Republicans want to identify with. Bill Schneider, thanks so much. Bill is part of the best political team on television. Now to do your own comparison and check where candidates stand on all the issues, check on cnn.com/elections. In addition to the latest news, you can also watch both debates once again. When HOUSECALL returns, taking supplements to beat back cancer. New studies show what works and what doesn't. And later..."", 'Dad, could you buy me some diabetes?', 'Could I have another dose of sugar?', 'Pretty please.', 'Please.', 'A big campaign of another kind. One state trying to get parents and kids to think before they eat.']","['NGUYEN', 'HOLMES', 'KRIS ANDERSSON, DIXIE LONGATE', 'HOLMES', 'NGUYEN', 'HOLMES', 'U.S. NGUYEN', 'HOLMES', 'NGUYEN', 'HOLMES', 'NGUYEN', 'HOLMES', 'NGUYEN', 'SANJAY GUPTA, HOST', 'GUPTA (voice-over)', 'MARK MEANEY, NATL.

Well, good evening, everyone. I'm Tony Harris. And we are focused tonight for most of this program on a raging, red hot emergency on the West Coast. Take a look at these pictures. Malibu, California; San Diego County up and down the Pacific Coast Highway, stampeding wildfires stopping for nothing and consuming everything in the way. Homes and buildings destroyed. Dozens more in the line of fire. At least one person is dead, some firefighters are hurt, and southern California is a smoky, fiery, dangerous mess tonight."", ""This fire's been very erratic. And it has moved rapidly when it has moved with the winds. And the fact that it's kind of come down below the ridge line up there has given us an opportunity to really work hard on it, but this fire is not over. It's not over until it's over. And we're a long way from there at this time."", ""A long way from there. OK, we all know that firefighters on the ground are fearless and plenty of people owe their homes and lives to their courage.

And brave work by the pilots of the L.A. fire department. But brother, that's close. To Malibu now where firefighters are on a - well, the wildfires are on a destructive rampage tonight. No other way to put it. CNN's Dan Simon is there. And Dan, we understand this fire is 0 percent contained?"", ""Zero percent contained, Tony. And we are standing in front of what was the Malibu Presbyterian Church. And all you can pretty much say is wow. This is one of the first structures that went up. It's really hard to say what we're looking at. Here, I believe this is the office because you can see a file cabinet over there. But to my left, it's undoubtedly where worshippers would have come on what should have been a calm Sunday morning. This is what happens when you have flying embers and high winds. We are told some of these embers were about a foot long. And you can see some of the hot spots still here at the church. So when you have these winds and the embers, this is what can happen. Take a look."", 'Fanned by gusts of up to 70 miles per hour, the fire ravaged several structures, including the Malibu Presbyterian Church and five high-priced Malibu homes.

These pictures from our California affiliate Los Angeles there, KCAL. And boy Dan, do you have a toll? At one point today, we heard anywhere from 20 to 23 buildings destroyed or damaged. Any update on that figure?"", ""That's what we're hearing, anywhere from 20 to 23. As you said, Tony, there's going to be obviously some more updates in the coming hours."", 'Yes.', ""But really the concern right now is these winds.

As much as well, 10,000 acres already blackened from two wildfires there in this area is where one person was killed. And at least four firefighters were injured. The fires are strongest in northern San Diego County, threatening homes in the Witch Creek area. Here's another view of the explosive power of these wildfires. These homes in the Malibu Canyon are fully engulfed by flames, torched by the hot and dry Santa Ana winds. So this really does beg the question, is this just the beginning? Or is relief on the way any time soon? Bonnie Schneider is in the CNN severe weather center for us. Bonnie, what's the answer to that question?"", 'Still ahead in the NEWSROOM, not even the most majestic structures can stand against nature. The Malibu fire destroys a landmark castle. That story just 60 seconds away.', ""The pictures are amazing, the events, terrifying. Flames flick at the homes of the rich and famous. Malibu is burning. And we take you there live. More than five million people without drinking water? That is a very real possibility in the state of Georgia. And the governor says it's Washington's fault."", ""The actions of the corps of engineers and the Fish and Wildlife Services are not only irresponsible, I believe they're downright dangerous. And Georgia cannot stand for this negligence."", ""Left high and dry by drought. Stealing the car was easy. Maybe a little bit too easy.

A man heads out for some drinks at the local bar, but a few too many ended with him crashing in the wrong house. It'll make you say, you've got to be kidding? You're in the NEWSROOM. So let's talk about these wildfires on the move. Hundreds are trying to outrun a series of blazes tonight in California. Evacuations are becoming more commonplace. Other families have lost everything. In Malibu, houses, businesses, and a church, even a castle all destroyed or heavily damaged. Firefighters say they are making some progress, but the acting mayor there says the blaze is 0 percent contained this hour. And in San Diego County, fires have killed one person and injured eight others, including some firefighters. Other losses are also stocking up. A Malibu landmark this hour is gutted. Hundreds of firefighters did their best, but they couldn't save Castle Kashan."", 'A landmark castle, a monumental fire. Tonight, what was once regal is now in ruins. On an ordinary day, Castle Kashan was picture perfect, but the past 24 hours have been anything but ordinary for residents along the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu.', ""When I woke up this morning, you couldn't even see outside the window, there was so much smoke. Quite a way to wake up."", ""Daniel Collins' day did not improve. Collins was staying at Castle Kashan as a house guest of philanthropist and socialite Lilly Lawrence, the daughter of a former Iranian oil minister. The two escaped as bricks were raining down."", ""Right before we left the property, they told us that the castle couldn't be saved."", 'Parched conditions, one of the driest years on regard, erratic powerful Santa Ana winds, all three combined igniting a threat into a reality.', 'We only had a couple of moments to gather some things. We never got back into the castle.', 'The castle wasn\'t in the fire\'s direct path, but whipping unpredictable winds fanned the embers. And firefighters were soon battling an unstoppable wall of flames. Lawrence says the loss is in the double-digit millions. Family heirlooms burned, paintings. And Elvis Presley memorabilia bought from his Graceland estate were all destroyed. The castle itself was only about 30 years old, built in the late 1970s by Dr. Thomas Hodges. It was used as a setting for shows like ""The Rockford Files"".', ""Incredibly beautiful. Filled with priceless antiques, and a view of the mountains in the back, and a view of the ocean in the front. And it's just a wonderful place to be."", ""Well, according to entertainment website TMZ, the Castle was actually in escrow and said to have a final walk through on Wednesday. The asking price was $17 million. We're not sure what price was actually negotiated. Still to come, reading, writing and arithmetic take a backseat at Pepperdine University. That's because the Malibu fires showed up on the doorstep. We will hear from some students hemmed in by the flames. That's just 90 seconds away. ."", ""Just more amazing photos to show you taken on the campus of Pepperdine University in the Malibu Hills. These photos taken by CNN viewers i-reporters at Pepperdine. The masks, anything to keep a smokeout. The school evacuated the dorms because of the southern California wildfires and gathered students in cafeterias and gymnasiums. We're told one campus outbuilding caught fire. No one hurt so far. Take a look at the Malibu Presbyterian Church near the campus of Pepperdine University. Totally engulfed. Totally destroyed as Dan Simon was mentioning at the top of the newscast. Witnesses say embers blowing in. The wind landed in the church steeple. Then the wind did the rest. And this church, a very special place to many Pepperdine students is gone. One of the students is on the phone with us right now. Lindsey Laubacher is calling in from Conorio, California. Lindsay, good to talk to you. Tell us more about this church, which I understand was pretty special to you and a lot of the students there at Pepperdine."", 'Yes, it definitely was. Very involved with, you know, the church itself. But we have on Tuesday night, university ministries every Tuesday night. And that was something that a lot of Pepperdine students got very involved in. I personally was very involved in it. And it definitely became my - you know, my church home. Definitely had a lot of special times and memories at that church.', ""Boy, take us back. Talk to us about your day. When did you get word someone either sending you a text, your phone going off, someone knocking on the door saying, uh-oh, it's time to go?"", 'About 7:00 this morning my time.', '00 in the morning?', '00 in the morning.', 'Wow!', 'Yes.', ""And what do you do? How much time did you have? I mean, you're clearly a little disoriented at that point. What did you do?"", 'Yes, they basically said get dressed and get down to the cafeteria. So you know, thrown on some clothes and went down. And there are tons of students down there already.', 'Did you take a look outside?', 'Yes, the sky was orange. It was - I saw the sun - orange sun was the theme tower in the background. It was pretty rare, weird sight.', 'Yes. Did you see just smoke? Did you see flames?', ""I didn't personally see any flames, but I know some people did."", 'Yes. How much time did you have to sort of grab whatever belongings you could get your hands on and get out of there?', 'About five minutes.', 'Whoo.', 'Yes.', 'Pretty scary?', 'Yes, definitely.', ""OK. So what's next for you? I mean, you're clearly in a place that's safe right now. Are you thinking about tomorrow, when you can get back to school, the classes?"", ""Well, I know classes are cancelled tomorrow.

I know it's kind of impossible to get through back to campus right now."", ""Yes, everything's shut down."", 'Yes.', ""Well, Lindsay, thanks for your time. We're happy you made it out OK."", 'Thanks.', 'All right, Lindsey.', ""And still to come in the NEWSROOM, you know, they don't look like they're related, so what's the family tie between Barack Obama and Dick Cheney? Find out 90 seconds from now in dog bone politics."", 'OK, we head back to Woodstock in tonight\'s edition of ""dogbone politics."" New York Senators Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer, they wanted to spend a million bucks in federal tax money on a museum to commemorate the 1969 music festival, which was held in their home state, but Senate Republicans said no way and blasted the project as a hippee museum. Republicans forced a vote that stripped the money from an education bill. The museum paid for with mostly private donations. It\'s still expected to open next year. The Pentagon\'s ""don\'t ask, don\'t tell"" policy on gays in the military is still very much in effect. That\'s why people, including people at the Pentagon, were surprised when military recruiting ads popped up on the glee.com website. Glee.com is a networking site for gay professionals. ""USA Today"" pointed out the ads to the military brass. And the ads soon disappeared. You probably have one and Barack Obama says he has one, too, a black sheep of the family. He used that line yesterday, referring to news that he and Vice President Dick Cheney are distant cousins. He had more fun talking about his new relative a few days ago on ""The Tonight Show"".', 'Did you know about this? Did you find out...', 'Yes, I actually did know -- people have been doing these genealogical...', 'Right.', ""...studies of me. And I've got all sorts of rogues in my background. You know, you're always hoping for you know, kings..."", 'Right.', '...and great leaders. .', 'Right.', 'And a children\'s charity might be the only winner in the recent spat between Rush Limbaugh and some Senate Democrats. The senators sent a letter to Limbaugh\'s bosses at Clear Channel Radio, blasting his recent comments about ""phony soldiers."" Limbaugh made the comment during a segment about an anti-war activist who faked his military service. He called the letter an attempt at censorship. And he put it up for bid on Ebay. It sold for more than $2 million. Limbaugh says he will match that money and then give all the money to charity. Republican presidential candidates squared off tonight in Orlando. And CNN is there live. Dana?', ""I'm Dana Bash in Orlando. Florida where Republican presidential candidates sparred on the same stage like they never have before over who's the best conservative and who's best to beat Hillary Clinton. More on that coming up in the NEWSROOM."", 'And the Republican presidential hopefuls squared off at a debate tonight. But at times, it seemed like a contest to see who could prove he was the most conservative candidate and who offered the best chance to beat Hillary Clinton next November. CNN\'s Dana Bash is standing by for us in Orlando, Florida. And Dana, how often did you hear the name ""Hillary Clinton"" in the Republican debate tonight?', 'A lot. I think I stopped counting, Tony. And certainly that was a big part of the debate. They were certainly prodded to talk about Hillary Clinton. But a big part of this debate tonight was who is best - who\'s most electable really. Who is best to beat the person - the Democratic candidate that the Republicans believed, just looking at the polls, will be their most likely Democratic opponent in November. And it\'s certainly got a little bit heated. Certainly there was some humor in a lot of the responses from Mitt Romney, from Rudy Giuliani, and even John McCain who had a - sort of a pointed answer, if you will, when he started talking about the fact -- started to hit Hillary Clinton for an earmark she tried to get in a funding bill this past week for a Woodstock museum. And John McCain, of course, a Vietnam war veteran, who we all know was held captive in Vietnam said that he was, ""tied up at the time."" It certainly elicited some laughter, but then a standing e ovation for him because of his patriotism. But Tony, that was a big part of it. But perhaps the headline here was the fact these Republican candidates sparred and sort of went after each other on the same stage in a way that they really never have before over the question that they\'ve been talking about long distance for the past several weeks, really for the past several months, but more heated in the past couple weeks. Who is the best conservative? And it was pointed and personal in a way that we really haven\'t seen before on that particular issue, going after each other on their credentials, on their record. Mitt Romney having to defend himself on that particular issue because he is somebody who is seen as perhaps a Johnny-come-lately on being socially conservative on issues like abortion. And Rudy Giuliani on the fact that he says that he is simply for pro - for abortion rights. And that\'s something that people are going to have to deal with. Fred Thompson also got into this in a way that he really hasn\'t before, which was quite interesting, Tony, because he is somebody who has not really shown his stuff so far.', ""Yes. OK, Dana Bash for us. Boy, that's a lot on your plate tonight. A lot in that debate. In Orlando for us, Dana, appreciate it, thank you. And still to come tonight, the flames are still burning in Malibu. We're headed back there next. We go live to the front lines of the fight. That is 90 seconds away. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM."", 'Thanks again to our CNNI reporters for sending in those amazing shots. Live pictures now as parts of the wildfire-ravaged Southern California coast -- you can see it for yourself -- continue to burn. That is prompting a declaration of hope, a prayer for a miracle and an urgent plea from the acting mayor of Malibu.', ""I'm hopeful that the fire will be contained, and I'm hopeful the winds will die down. And at this point, they're not forecasting that. We're just hoping for a miracle to happen and that winds stop blowing the flames. And the embers are flying. So we'll know in the morning what it's going to look like, but, at this point, like I said, it's 0 percent contained, and that is a very fluid situation, and we're just going to say prayers and, hopefully, everyone will be fine. The most important thing is that people are ready to evacuate. If the call comes, just go. Nothing is more important than human life."", ""You know, it is just after 7:30 p.m. on the West Coast, but it won't be quitting time for firefighters for some time now. Let's check back with our Dan Simon in Malibu. And, Dan, you can't see the pictures that we're showing folks at home of this wildfire maybe in a canyon. But I will you what, we can certainly understand by looking at these pictures why this is 0 percent contained. Give us the view from where you are."", ""Well, first of all, the winds have really kicked up within the past 30 minutes. You know, it got calmer around 5:00 this evening here in Malibu, and then all of a sudden, the winds just started fanning again. And let me show you where we are. This is the Malibu Presbyterian Church. And, by the way, you know, two things that you've got to have with you if you're up here. You've got to have a mask and you've got to have some goggles because the smoke is just absolutely fierce. I've got this really bad burning sensation in my eyes right now. But, in any case, over there where the pink (ph) camera is, that is where parishioners would have come on what should have been a relatively calm Sunday morning, but, no, you didn't have it. Over here, I believe, is where the office is because you can see a file cabinet. As we mentioned earlier, somewhere between 20 and 23 structures have been damaged or destroyed. We know at least five homes were completely leveled. A lot of people in the area were doing what they could to, you know, be proactive and try to prevent the flames from reaching their house. Jeffrey Katzenberg, you know, the movie mogul -- it looked like Christmas in front of his house. There was so much foam in front of it. He was doing whatever he could to prevent the fire from reaching his house. But we're going to be up here for the better part of the night, Tony, and, obviously, firefighters working around the clock trying to put out any hot spots they might see."", ""Hey, Dan, very quickly, how nasty is that smoke? How acrid is it? Describe that for folks who've never been in a wildfire. It is pretty nasty stuff."", ""Well, if you have asthma, you don't want to be up here, first of all. It's just really, really tough. It's -- on your eyes, it's awful. You've got to have these goggles. Between breaks, between our live shots, we've been putting these goggles on just to try to prevent the burning sensation of the eyes. It's tough."", ""I didn't do you a real favor by asking that last question. All right. Get the goggles on, Dan. Appreciate it. Thank you. And joining us by phone now is Ron Harrelson of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. He is a fire inspector. And, Ron, good to talk to you. Thanks for your time this evening."", 'Sure. Thank you.', 'Hey, Ron, do you -- can you give us a clue as to -- boy, I remember -- it seems like it was about, oh, 6:30, maybe 8:00 this morning Eastern Time when I started to receive the e-mails about this fire. When did this actually start? Do you know?', ""This major fire, the one we're talking about here in Malibu, started about 5:00 a.m. this morning West Coast Time, and we are still actively in a fierce firefight right now. We're getting pretty much no relief from the wind, as you heard."", 'Yeah. There was a bit of a break earlier, but I think everyone anticipated that the winds would kick up again. And talk to us about why that makes battling this fire -- any fire -- so difficult.', ""Because there's no clear direction of the fire. You're getting erratic winds and swirls. We're getting gusts up to 60 miles an hour at the height of these winds today, and they die down for a little bit, but then we're getting spot fires. There are fires that would start well ahead of the main body of the fire, embers landing on rooftops, in trees, and now you've got multiple fires in a huge area."", 'Do you know what started this?', ""We don't know the exact cause right now. It could possibly have been downed power lines. When the high winds happen, we get a lot of calls for downed power lines, and the first arriving units here in Malibu did discover some wires down in an area where the fire started."", 'Do you attack this fire differently in the evening than you would in daylight hours?', ""We continue our efforts on the ground and in the air. I know our helicopters, depending on the wind conditions and at the pilots' discretion, and the incident commander will make that call. Nighttime presents new hazards as far as visibility with the smoke and fires and things of that sort. So we have to be careful with that, and we'll just continue our efforts throughout the night."", 'What are your prospects for containment? The last word we received was that the fire was now 0 percent contained.', ""That's correct. That's because we still have open flame fronts that are still actively burning, and we have not created or had the opportunity, due to the winds pushing this fire, to put a line around this fire, so we could try to contain or control it."", 'Boy, Ron Harrelson, Los Angeles County fire inspector, with us. Ron, thanks for your time this evening.', 'Thank you. Be safe.', 'And you too. You too.', 'Still to come in the NEWSROOM, the wells are running dry in Georgia literally.', ""On top of that, we're also mired in a frustrating manmade disaster of federal bureaucracy."", ""Well, the governor isn't laying the blame on nature, but on Washington. The story is next."", ""You know, most Georgia lakes are nothing but big puddles, and tonight, the state's water supply keeps dwindling. Eighty-five counties are now in a state of emergency. And if dealing with the drought isn't enough, the governor says he's also facing a federal bureaucratic nightmare. Here's CNN's Josh Levs."", 'The descriptions are frightening.', ""Drought is a natural disaster. We're experiencing the single worst drought in North Georgia's history."", ""How bad is it? This pole at Lake Allatoona is supposed to be a buoy. These before and after images show how Lake Lanier has changed. It's the biggest source of drinking water in North Georgia. State officials estimate the lake has about three months of readily available drinking water left. Georgia's governor says this isn't just a story of natural disaster."", ""We're also mired in a frustrating manmade disaster of federal bureaucracy. The actions of the Corps of Engineers and the Fish and Wildlife Services are not only irresponsible. I believe they're downright dangerous."", ""Why? What are those agencies doing? Some of Georgia's water flows to Alabama and Florida where it helps cool power plants and helps keep alive freshwater mussels and sturgeon, protected under the Endangered Species Act. Georgia says 3.2 billion gallons leave the state each day."", ""And we've been legally required to make those releases, and we've been doing those."", ""But Georgia officials say the Corps can legally cut back on those releases. The state points out that the Fish and Wildlife Service says the Corps operates the reservoir by its own operating plans and that the Endangered Species Act allows flexibility and expedited action in a drought. But, so far, no change. So Georgia's Republican governor is calling on his friends to pay him back for some of his political support."", 'We need the president to cut through the tangle of unnecessary bureaucracy to manage our resources prudently.', 'And the governor says he learned lessons from Hurricane Katrina that a state should take action before a potential disaster arrives and make sure the necessary resources are there. Josh Levs, CNN, Atlanta.', 'Well, Sonny Perdue says conservation can only go so far. He was in the newsroom earlier.', ""We're willing to conserve, but that doesn't do any good to conserve if the Corps and the Fish and Wildlife still send more than twice of the water needed down the stream and beyond that dam. We can't conserve our way out of this if they don't cooperate, and that's why I'm asking the president to intervene so that we can get some common-sense decisions out of Fish and Wildlife and the Corps of Engineers."", 'The White House says it has already started drafting interim rules to deal with the endangered species issue. You know, it was funny when Macaulay Culkin fought off burglars in the movie Home Alone, but it became all too real for one Florida boy.', ""Oh, my God! He's hitting my dog!"", 'OK. Stay on the line with me. Luis. Luis.', 'More details on this crazy, crazy story coming up next in the NEWSROOM.', ""Well, they're just teenagers, but they're already heroes. A Scout troop jumped into action when a Pennsylvania hiker fell. The Scouts found Jane Scholl bleeding, disoriented, unable to walk, so they carried her three miles to a rescue chopper. They didn't know how serious Shoal's injuries were, so they made a stretcher."", 'We laid the two sticks out, and we put the two sticks through each of our sleeves, and we just made it long enough for her body and just laid her down, and we just -- we all picked her up and carried her down to where the chopper was waiting for her.', ""They did an outstanding job. I believe they actually saved the woman's life."", 'I would need to use it, but I never thought it would come this soon, and so it was like, wow, I really helped someone today.', ""They were amazing. I'm going to send them a check just like so that they can go out and do something fun because they were amazing."", ""Did you see the cut on her eye there? Scholl suffered that cut and a concussion, but other than that, she's OK. Who knows? Maybe an accused Florida burglar did his homework. He just wasn't counting on a young kid missing a school bus that day. Here's Laura Diaz from CNN Orlando affiliate WKMG with a unique story about being home, but not alone."", ""Someone's trying to break in my house."", 'That frazzled voice is from 13-year-old Luis Gomez. After missing a school bus one morning, he was home alone. That is until this man, Mario Baez, paid him a visit.', 'At first, I knew what to do because I saw those videos that tell you when a burglar comes in and what you need to do.', ""Gomez didn't answer the door after he saw through the peephole that he didn't know the man. Instead, he called 911, and that's when things got dangerous."", ""He's getting in. He's getting in. He's getting in."", 'Where -- where -- go into a room or something. Lock yourself in.', 'Gomez did just that. First, he put whatever he could find in front of the bedroom door, and then he hid in the bathroom and locked that door, too. Baez busted right through the front door, breaking the frame. He took a pillow case and packed it full with PlayStation, Game Cub and a laptop. Gomez then quietly called his mom at work.', 'And he told me, ""Mom, there\'s somebody in the house, and he\'s packing up the stuff.""', 'Roxie, the family dog, tried to help by barking, but Baez kicked her.', ""Oh, my God! He's hitting my dog!"", 'OK. Stay on the line with me. Luis. Luis.', 'It all ended happily, though. The cops came and so did some relief for Gomez.', 'OK, Luis. Go ahead and talk to them, OK.', ""It's all right. Go ahead and hang up. Are you OK?"", 'OK. Bye-bye.', ""And that was Laura Diaz from CNN affiliate WKMG. By the way, the police filed a litany of charges against the accused burglar, including cruelty to animals for supposedly kicking the family's pet. You know, the keys were on the seat, the door was unlocked, but this car wasn't easy pickings for this criminal. It was bait. He took it. Outrageous pictures you don't want to miss straight ahead in the CNN NEWSROOM."", ""Boy, this next story. A Seattle area car thief thought he made a clean getaway. Little did he know things were about to get really messy for him. That's because police set out some baits, and he took it. Here's Dennis Bounds of our affiliate KING."", ""This was the scene back in March after a thief stole a car from Bellevue Community College. Police chased the man down as he made his getaway in a police bait car. A camera hidden in the bait car's ashtray captures video of a thief at work.

Salt Lake City and Adolf Hitler, two names you might not expect to see on one police blotter, but they're there tonight, and all we can say is you've got to be kidding. Get a good look at this vase. It was a gift to the Nazi leader in 1933. Now a couple of years ago, someone swiped it out of a storage unit. It turned up this week, but authorities are looking into more than just a burglary. They're also trying to figure out if the American soldier who bought the vase and actually brought it home decades ago obtained it legally. Kidnapped and held for ransom, it was going to take $350,000 to get Eldo (ph), the German shepherd, back. His owners are a wealthy older couple in Colombia. The captors played on their emotions -- listen to this -- sending pictures of the dog bound in chains with a note about how it cried at night. What they weren't counting on was Bogota police. They're well trained to find people in one of the world's worst kidnapping capitals, and they didn't do so badly with this dog either. Tonight, Eldo (ph) and family reunited. Florida police say it was in the cards months ago. They gave state inmates a unique deck highlighting 104 of Florida's most troubled and troubling unsolved homicides and missing persons cases. Guess what? A tip came up during a prison card game. It was just the break Fort Myers police needed to make an arrest in a 3-year-old homicide. And, finally, there he was, snoring, on the couch, almost naked with his clothes strewn all over. Florida police say Hugo Acosta had too much to drink and went to a stranger's house, popped open a window and crashed. Oh, but he made a sandwich before he went to sleep and even found some sheets in a closet to cover up with. He was sleeping in jail the next night."", ""Boy, look at those pictures. Let's get another check of conditions out in California. Live pictures there from KCAL, our Los Angeles affiliate. Bonnie Schneider is in the severe weather center. And, Bonnie, talk us through conditions as we look ahead through the overnight hours and into tomorrow in Malibu."", ""Unfortunately, Tony, they are going to get worse. The winds will actually pick up into the overnight hours and the early morning hours and then subside again a bit in the afternoon, but really just a bit because current wind speeds right now in Malibu out of the Northeast, 21 miles per hour. We're getting gusts as high as 30 miles per hour to the south in Long Beach at the airport there. So the forecast is calling for strong winds out of the Northeast. Those Santa Ana winds persist. On Monday, we'll see wind gusts possibly as high in areas of Ventura County, up to 60 miles per hour. That doesn't mean we'll see those gusts throughout the entire region of Southern California. Relative humidity will be very dry, 5 to 10 percent, and not only that. We've been talking about the wind, but what about the heat? Look at these temperatures for L.A. Tony, we're going to see temperatures soar into the 90s. This is October. Ninety-two degrees on Tuesday. Notice the winds start to die down and come out of the East a little bit more as we get towards the middle of the week, but very hot and dry for tomorrow and for Tuesday."", ""Boy, that's for sure. Bonnie, appreciate it. Thank you. Let's get back to Dan Simon in Malibu for a final check before we get out of here this evening. And, Dan, talk us through again, if you would -- smart man, very good, with the goggles on. Give us an update on conditions out there right now, winds on the ground."", ""Yeah. Well, you know, you heard Bonnie Schneider talk about those wind gusts. We're feeling them now, certainly in the area of 20 miles per hour. You can see the firefighter here in the background putting out these hot spots here at the Malibu Presbyterian Church, which, as you can see, has totally been leveled by this blaze. In terms of the smoke and how intense it is, this is why you need the goggles and you need the masks. If you can show this light here, I think that gives you kind of a good perspective, Tony. Can you see the smoke there..."", 'Yeah, absolutely.', '... sort of whiffing around by that light?', 'Yeah.', ""That gives you an idea of the elements we are facing here. The concern tonight: the hot spots. Crews, obviously, going to be out here throughout the night putting out any hot spots they might see, but these embers -- they're still flying around a bit. Some of these embers about a foot long, two inches wide. That gives you an idea of how you can have some major devastation here at Malibu. That's what you had this morning with this church. As many as 20 to 25 structures, Tony, damaged or destroyed. So still a precarious situation out here."", ""OK. Dan Simon for us in Malibu. Dan, appreciate it. Thank you. I'm Tony Harris.

CNN-121454,HOUSE CALL WITH DR. SANJAY GUPTA,2007-11-17,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0711/17/hcsg.01.html,,How Your Vote Can Impact Your Health; Will SCHIP Move Forward?; Paying the Price for Your Health,"[""It's your health."", 'Universal.', 'Affordable.', 'Health care.', 'The premiums are getting higher and higher and higher.', ""Most families want health care, but they can't afford it."", 'Universal health care is an American value.', ""We're going to bring down the cost of health insurance in this country."", 'Health care.', 'Health care.', 'Health care.', 'Health care.', ""It's on the candidates' mind and it's on yours as well. Your vote can impact your health. We're making the rounds this morning of the things you need to know this election season. First up, will SCHIP ever move forward? What is it? And how did health care for kids become such a hot button issue? We'll look at the face of this controversy. Then, the politics of the cure. Should cancer treatment be a priority in your candidate's platform? And paying the price for your health. How to find affordable prescription drugs. We're going to have all of that. Let's get it started, though, with the battle to pass an expanded SCHIP bill, which would provide health care for millions of American children. And we talked a lot about the price tag and the battle between Congress and the White House. But behind all the political posturing and all the people are children with no health insurance."", 'Thank you.', 'When 16-year-old Heather lived in New Jersey with her dad, she had health insurance. But when she moved down to Maryland to live with her mom, Cindy Marrocco, she was no longer covered.', ""I couldn't get her on my insurance. I had to take her to the doctor. It was really, really imperative that I took her right away."", ""So the doctor told Cindy about getting health insurance for her daughter through Maryland Children's Health Insurance Program. It's Maryland's version of"", ""It's been a blessing because Heather had to see a doctor, a therapist, and get prescriptions. And I would have been in financial trouble having to pay those bills."", ""Cindy now wants to move her two younger children to SCHIP as well. They're now covered by her health insurance policy, but she can't afford it."", 'I only make $30,000 a year. It costs me $70 a week to keep those kids covered.', ""The children won't qualify for SCHIP for six months. And by then, Cindy might be working a better shift, more overtime. She might be making too much money to qualify for SCHIP, but still not enough to afford insurance. Currently, to be eligible for SCHIP, the family income has to be no more than $41,300. That's twice the federal poverty level. The latest version by Congress would up that to nearly $62,000, which is three times the poverty level. That would cost an additional $35 billion. Currently over 600,000 adults in 13 states are covered by SCHIP. This and funding the higher cost with a 61-cent tobacco tax are two reasons why some oppose the SCHIP bill."", ""And I made it perfectly clear that if you keep passing this piece of legislation, I'm going to keep vetoing it."", ""And that's something Cindy finds hard to accept."", ""We have little kids all over the place that have no health insurance. It's insane that he would say oh, no, that's too much money."", 'Soon, only one of her three children will be insured. And she waits for a final SCHIP decision.', ""And to be clear, the SCHIP bill is still in limbo, but a continued resolution has been signed, which will keep it funded until mid-December. We're going to, of course, keep you up dated on the battle and of course about the children in the middle as well. Health insurance, along with other health issues, are critical to the majority of voters. We know that. The numbers say it all. In the latest CNN poll, 76 percent of Americans say health care is very or extremely important to their vote for president. Our CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider is digging down on this issue. Bill, CNN held a Democratic debate on Thursday. What are the candidates saying about health care?"", ""Health care was the very first issue out of the box, when Hillary Clinton made accusations that her opponents really didn't support universal health care. She said John Edwards did not support it when he ran for president in 2004. He eventually went on the ticket, of course, as the vice-presidential nominee. And she said that Barack Obama's plan really didn't support the idea of universal health care because it didn't have a mandate requiring everyone to have health insurance. She said her plan does that. Barack Obama defended himself and said what's more important is not a mandate, but that people should be able to afford to buy health insurance. And he had a plan that would help people afford it. And eventually, of course, then everyone would be able to have health insurance. So there was a lot of sparring back and forth about who had the best plan and how to achieve universal health insurance."", 'Bill, it seems that when it comes to health care, people are very clear on what their number one issue is.', ""Their number one issue is health insurance. Lacking health insurance, being able to afford health insurance. That is by far the number one thing people worry about. And that was of course the issue that came up in the Democrats debate. Health insurance costs have escalated. A lot of Americans find they no longer can afford not just health care, but the premiums for health insurance because they've skyrocketed. The cost has skyrocketed so much. That has now surpassed the cost of prescription drugs as the number one issue. The majority of Americans cite the availability and cost of health insurance, prescription drugs is a good deal lower in people's priorities when it comes to health care."", ""All right. Bill Schneider, thanks.

Coming up on HOUSE CALL, we have some ways to get the insurance companies to pay. And billions of dollars are spent on cancer research, but are we really any closer to a cure? We'll have a reality check in one minute."", 'You have to think of this more against cancer for what it is. And what it is is a war of attrition. You know, the enemy is not going away.']","['RUDY GIULIANI', 'UNIDENTIFIED MALE', 'SEN.

CNN-122602,CNN NEWSROOM,2008-1-5,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0801/05/cnr.06.html,,Ballot Bowl '08: New Hampshire Primary,"['Welcome back to the CNN ""Ballot Bowl."" You see there, the spectacular Bedford Village Inn Bedford, New Hampshire. We appreciate their hospitality, today as we share with the candidates for president in their own words. The New Hampshire primary, three days from now, a critical leadoff primary, especially fresh from the Iowa caucuses where both the Democratic and the Republican race tossed into volatility by the victories of Obama on the Democratic side, Huckabee on the Republican side. Our partner here, in New Hampshire, affiliate WMUR has been doing a remarkable job sitting down with the candidates so that they can meet New Hampshire voters and take their questions and speak to them on any subject. We want to share with you now what the call ""Candidate Cafe"" with candidate, Rudy Giuliani.', 'How are you? How are you doing? Good morning. What would you like to know?', 'How about those Red Sox?', ""Congratulations. Congratulations. As an American League fan, I'm happy for the Red Sox, I always like to see the American league do well, it tells me the Yankees are better that way. Joe Torre is a close, personal friend. So it's -- the Joe Torre part is a personal part. I'm going to miss him. He was the Yankee manager in '96. That was the first Yankee championship since '78. I was the mayor then. The Yankee championship was kind of symbolic of the comeback in New York City, sometimes I kid around and say I'm going to put Joe Torre on my ticket as vice president."", ""Hey, you'd win."", ""But he comes from Brooklyn, too. I was very unusual. I was a Yankee fan in Brooklyn. Not by choice, by my father's design. My father came from Manhattan, my mother came from Brooklyn. My father was required to live in Brooklyn because of my mother's family. She wanted him to live with her family, so he always resented it, and he secretly made me a Yankee fan. Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio, and by the time I was able to go out and play with the other kids, I was in a Yankee uniforms and they were throwing me in the mud."", 'We need to change the subject, so I would like to know what your favorite reading material is, what you like to read and, or enjoy reading?', 'I guess I have always liked reading history the most and biographies and that comes from my mom. My mom was a frustrated teacher, meaning she wanted to be a teacher all her life, she got interrupted by the depression. She was -- my mother was very, very smart and very well read. I always thought I was her only real student and she loved teaching and she was very good at it.', 'What made you decide to go into law? And once you got there, what made you decide you wanted to be a mayor?', ""I graduated high school and was going to go to the seminary. I was going to join the Mannford Fathers Seminary and then I changed my mind about half -- about a third of the way through that summer and I decided I wanted to go to college and go into premed. I took some kind of aptitude test, where you press these little things and I sat with my advisor, and he said, you have real aptitude for reasoning, logic and reasoning, and maybe you should think about law. I started thinking, I know so much about what's wrong with New York City, maybe I should be the mayor, maybe I should run for mayor. I never tried to be in the hands of one person giving me the view of the organization. I used to require my commissioners to come to city hall with their deputies, never alone. This idea that you want people around you to just tell you what you want to hear, well, you have to be stupid to want that."", 'What do you feel is your greatest accomplishment?', ""I think probably the thing I'm the proudest of is changing around the spirit of New York City. Not the specific things that we got right, even the specific things that we got wrong, because you make mistakes. I think ultimately what a leader -- political leader has to do is to get people to believe in themselves, and I even think that that was the most important thing we did to help the city get ready for what we didn't know what's going to happen, which was September 11."", 'One of the interviews you conducted, somebody asked you, well, what are you doing for yourself? How do you keep yourself going in the midst of this tragedy? And I remember that you talked about certainly faith and family, but you also said you went back and reread some of the history and some of the other leaders that had saved crises.', ""While I was on the street still dealing with it, I kept thinking, I'm going to have to explain this to my people. I'm going to have to explain it to them. I'm going to have to give them the framework to deal with this because they are going to be - they're going to be lost, just like I am to some extent. And, so my mind immediately got to, who has gone through something like this before? And my first thought was nobody. What was it about Churchill, what did he say, what did he do and how did he act? And the conclusion I came to reading those pages, which I can summarize quickly, I mean, there are a lot of things is, he became defiant. And I thought, well, I'm going to have to find a way to do that for the people of New York. And that's why I kept appealing to them to keep moving forward. There were only two places that I relaxed, from September 11 until the day I left office, which was four months later. And one was, watching baseball. The Yankees were in the World Series that year with the Arizona Diamondbacks and the other was watching my son's freshman football games. He played freshman football then. I'd be standing there and like a surreal experience, I'd be standing there at St. Joseph's High School watching my son play football and all of the kids just trying to tackle each other and it would say to me, life is going -- it's not normal right now, life is not normal right now for so many people and for me. But it's going to get back to normal. Maybe it's a great microcosm of how life ultimately should be. You know, we play by rules and the best person wins and, you know, that. So I guess -- and then also it's just plain fun."", 'Rudy Giuliani there in his own words as part of the wonderful ""Candidate Cafe"" series presented by our affiliate and partner, here in New Hampshire, WMUR-TV. You\'re watching continuing coverage of the CNN ""Ballot Bowl."" The candidates, Democrat and Republican for president in their own words, unfiltered throughout the day. A quick up date before we get back to the candidates. There is a lot of action here in New Hampshire, but action today in the presidential race out in Wyoming, as well. New Hampshire votes Tuesday, Wyoming is voting today. Republican caucuses in the state of Wyoming, 12 delegates at stake, about 58 percent of the state in so far. You see 12 delegates at stale, six for the former Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney, one for California congressman Duncan Hunter. Six for Romney, one for Hunter as the counting continues out of the state of Wyoming, a small state, a modest amount of delegates there, but in such a competitive race, every delegate counts, so we will continue to track the results in Wyoming. We also, later today, will have the first CNN/WMUR University of New Hampshire presidential tracking poll, here in New Hampshire. The first glips glimpse how the results out in Iowa affected the race here in New Hampshire. Out in Iowa, the big surprises were Obama and Huckabee, but they are not the only surprises in this remarkable presidential election. A candidate written off as perhaps dead politically, just a few months ago, is the Arizona Republican senator John McCain. Our latest poll, and again, we\'re awaiting our new poll today, shows him in a dead heat here in the state of New Hampshire with Romney. This is a state, of course, with the maverick McCain burst onto the scene back in 2000, when he unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination. Back now to Dana Bash, who is helping to track the Republican candidates here in the state of New Hampshire. And Dana, quite a bit at stake for Senator McCain.', 'Absolutely, everything at state for Senator McCain, at stake for Senator McCain, rather, in this state of New Hampshire, as you said, because this is his territory, this is his political home. This is where he did extraordinarily well, surprisingly well, of course, back in 2000, beating George W. Bush and this is where he has been basically camping out since, you know, for the past several months. You know, it\'s really interesting, John, I remember talking to Senator McCain, I covered Congress, back in Washington, at his, probably his lowest point, back in the spring when he had run out of money or the majority of his staff quit and he said, you know, I\'m just going to go back up to New Hampshire and I\'m going to keep talking about what I have done, here in Washington, here in the Senate. The fact that I reached across the aisle, that I have proven that I can show bipartisanship. And that is exactly what he\'s doing. And if you look at the crowds and you look at the polls, it seems to be working for him. He has Senator Joe Lieberman, former Democrat, now Independent, with him, he endorsed Senator McCain that is being used to illustrate the fact he can reach across the aisle. And he\'s also trying to say that he can change. Mitt Romney is using the word ""change"" pretty much every other -- every word that he uses is ""change,"" but John McCain is sort of responding to that by saying: I can be an agent for change, and I will do that with my experience in Washington. Unclear whether or not he\'s going to be able to sell that at the age of 71, that he an agent of change, but certainly he\'s trying. And if you look at what happened earlier today in Petersboro, New Hampshire, he had an oversized crowd. Our producer, Tasha Diakias (ph) was there, said that it was so crowded about 800 people, the fire marshal essentially had to close the doors. And we\'ll give you a little bit of a taste of what he said to the voters there, earlier today.', ""I'm running for president of United States for two reasons, and the first reason is that I want to restore trust and confidence in our government. The American people have lost that trust and confidence. You can look at any poll, you can look at any -- talk to any American and it's because we've done a number of things wrong, but the biggest thing I think are Republican base as well as most American are unhappy about is the spending and corruption in Washington. I don't use the word corruption lightly. We have former members of congress residing in federal prison, and we have a system that earmarking and pork barrel spending that is -- that has been in disgrace and outrage and betrayal of our Republican principles of being careful stewards of your tax dollars. My friends..."", ""And there you heard John McCain clearly trying to tout his national security experience, his experience on the foreign stage. But, also a large part of what we just heard was him appealing to New Hampshire Republicans who absolutely cannot stand the fact that the federal deficit has grown, that federal spending has grown. Under Republican control, mostly in Washington, John McCain making the point very clearly he gets them, that he is one of them when it comes to that particular sense of the fact that spending should be cut down and that is why he's hitting that extremely hard here. And that is one of the many reasons why John McCain through just staying here, going -- doing what you just saw, taking tough questions from the voters of New Hampshire, has risen in the polls, risen from basically the point where everybody thought he was politically over. And that, what you just heard, is a big reason why -- John."", 'Dana Bash on the streets of Manchester. More from Dana later in the program. I spoke with Senator McCain yesterday, by the way, and he says voters looking for change, look what he did on Iraq policy. He said he forced a change in Iraq policy that he makes the case is now saving American lives. Fascinating to watch the senator make his case, here in New Hampshire. The person perhaps with the most at stake, especially after Iowa here in the state of New Hampshire, the one-time presumptive Democratic nominee, Senator Hillary Clinton. Suzanne Malveaux tracking the Clinton campaign and with us on the other side of the break. Please stay with us. You\'re watching the CNN ""Ballot Bow,"" the candidates for president in their own words, just three days away from the leadoff presidential primary here in the state of New Hampshire.', 'Welcome back to the CNN ""Ballot Bowl,"" I\'m John King in Bedford, New Hampshire. Just before the break, we were talking about one of the candidates in an upbeat mood, here in the state of New Hampshire, Republican John McCain. Well, if there is a candidate that has perhaps the most at stake in the New Hampshire primary, it is the candidate who just weeks and months ago was considered by far away the Democratic frontrunner, Senator Hillary Clinton of New York. Our Suzanne Malveaux, tracking the Democratic campaign. And Suzanne, Senator Clinton has to know this is a state that is critical to her future chances.', 'Absolutely, John. And I spoke with Clinton aides, if there was anything, lessons learned from Iowa, they said they made the mistake of underestimating the youth vote and that is why we have today, she added, at the last minute a round table with young, undecided voters who she\'ll be addressing. Aides say that they will be aboard her bus at some point today. And also on FaceBook, they\'ve added this ""Ask Hillary"" segment, so they can ask questions to the candidate base. Say, they are redoubling their efforts in this state to reach out to those young voters, the ones that Senator Barack Obama captured. Now, the one thing that they said was not a mistake was the emphasis on her experience. They believe if they can put her in front of these crowds and make the case that she can talk about any issue at any time, that they have won the voters over. I saw earlier today, at an event I attended, they had people -- hundreds of people who could not get into this packed room. The fire marshals were concerned about having enough chairs. Senator Clinton took over, told Chelsea, her daughter, make room. You had people sitting on the floors. They managed to get all of those people inside and they did something unprecedented, John. For two hours she answered all of their questions, any questions they had and there were two things the aides say she wanted to do, essentially answer the question, who can lead day one? And also who can win? And so she started off talking about her Iraq policy.', ""The next president is going to face a lot of problems on that first day, January 20, 2009. We have a war to end in Iraq, we've got a war to resolve in Afghanistan, we've got 47 million uninsured Americans, we have an economy that is faltering and I don't know what the economists are going to say, but I think it's slipping into a recession and we've got to take action, now. We've got an energy crisis with $100 a barrel oil, that is contributing to the economic challenges we face, and then we've got to be absolutely committed to repairing the damage that has been done by the Bush administration around the world and here at home. So, there's a lot to be done, and I have proposed comprehensive plans to deal with healthcare for everyone, an energy agenda that will be energy efficient, create clean, renewable energy, get us off of other dependence on foreign oil. We cannot continue with that kind of backwards economic approach. And there's so much more to be done. And I've laid out all of these plans in the campaign. I think you need to realize that withdrawing troops is dangerous. You don't just wake up one morning and say, OK, load everybody up, take them out. You have to guard the exit routes, which means you need troops protecting the convoys. You have to take out the equipment, you can't leave that. We don't want that to fall into the wrong hands. I also believe you've to plan for what you will do with our civilians. We have over 100,000 American citizens who are not in the military, they work for the embassy, they work for businesses, they work for nonprofit agencies that are there. And I have injected into this debate about withdrawal something I feel very strongly about. We have to figure out what we are going to do with the Iraqis who helped us. A lot of Iraqis put their lives on the line..."", ""And, John, she also talked about the idea of withdrawing one to two brigades each month. So, starting the first 60 days, that troop withdrawal would begin and then would continue. But, what she's trying to do is essentially say that she will sit down and take this in a measured tone, but that she, as the other candidates would like, essentially to get out of Iraq as quickly as possible. But, that she has the experience and she has the policy in mind that she will sit down with the commanders on the ground and try to find out what is the most prudent way of doing this. Now, covering the Clintons, as you and I both know, generally speaking, if they feel they're up against a formidable foe, it's punch-counterpunch. Well, it's a very difficult and delicate balancing act for Senator Clinton, up against Senator Barack Obama. Aides say that they are not going to go negative here, but obviously in trying to make this point here, that experience really matters and that she has the experience to bring about change, she decided not to necessarily go after Senator Obama on this specifically, but rather she used an example with President Bush to make the point. Let's take a listen."", ""It's hard to remember how in 2000 he said he would be a uniter, not a divider, he was going to bring America together, he was going to end partisanship, he was going to have people working together, that he didn't need a lot of experience because he had good interruption and he understood people and he'd be able to meet with these rogue leaders, look into their eyes and their soul and solve our problems. Remember that?"", ""So, John, she really is implying here that look, you had somebody who didn't have that kind of foreign policy experience that was necessary, look what ended up happening in that situation, perhaps inferring that something similar to that would happen if you didn't have somebody with an experienced hand in that position. Now, finally, the other point that she made here is that she is trying to set up the scenario where she says, look, day one it's going to be a serious situation, perhaps a crisis, that this is a dangerous world. Now, we know that the campaign talks about the Bush administration using fear as a tactic, but there certainly is a sense she is using this kind of warninging of the potential dangers in the world to make the case that she's the one, as opposed to her opponents, who is ready to go in from day one. Let's take a listen."", ""And look what happened in Great Britain. Tony Blair leaves, Gordon Brown comes in, the very next day, there are terrorist attacks. Thankfully, they were unsuccessful, from London to Scotland. So, you've got to be prepared on day one with everything ready to go. And I'm afraid we are going to have a lot of work to do to get us in a good shape when it comes to emergency preparedness."", ""John, tonight you know, there's a debate among the Democrats and aides can see this is going to be a very big and important debate for Senator Clinton, that she's going to have to come out fighting on these specific points, that she going to have to make her case because obviously everybody is talking about change, here. They have won these young voters to Senator Barack Obama. He improved when it came to women, as well. So, she is really going to have to make the case she can bring about that change, but she's also going to have to use this experience argument. She's been doing that so far. We see how it worked in Iowa. We're going to have to see how it works in New Hampshire - John."", 'Suzanne Malveaux. And it is fascinating to watch Senator Clinton having to try to save her campaign in the very state her husband self designated himself the ""Come Back Kid,"" back in 1992, 16 years ago, Bill Clinton saving his campaign for president after the character crisis, you might call it, here in the state of New Hampshire. Bill Clinton worth noting placed second in the 1992 New Hampshire primary to revive his campaign, many believe Senator Clinton, this time, cannot afford anything but first. The CNN ""Ballot Bowl"" continues on the other side of the break. I\'ll take a bit of a break, but back with you later today. But when we return, discussion of a candidate who is not making much of a push here, in New Hampshire. He will be part of some weekend debate, but instead he is looking after a third place finish in Iowa, to somehow revive his Republican campaign elsewhere. Out her in New Hampshire, he is the former Tennessee senator, Fred Thompson. Stay with us, more of CNN\'s ""Ballot Bowl,"" the candidates, unvarnished and in their own word, just ahead.', ""Hello, I'm Suzanne Malveaux, John will rejoin me in just a little while. Welcome back to BALLOT BOWL 08. To our up most personal look at the presidential race as it touches down here in New Hampshire. The first in the nation's primary on Tuesday, this year a mere five days after the Iowa Caucasus. Now in just a few minute from now we will hear from Democratic candidate Bill Richardson, who finished fourth in Iowa and remains in the race for the White House. First let's ask that question, where is Fred? As in the former Tennessee senator and some might say part-time presidential candidate, Fred Thompson. Fresh from his uninspiring fourth place finish in Iowa, he has no scheduled appearances today. So let's ask, what is going on with Fred? Let's ask our own CNN's congressional correspondent, Dana Bash. Dana."", ""Suzanne, Fred Thompson is here in New Hampshire. He's going to participate in a debate tonight. There's another debate tomorrow night. So he is going to sort of be a part of the mix. But you're right; he has absolutely no public schedule here in New Hampshire. He's not campaigning here and never, at least over the past month or two, it was pretty clear he was not a contender here. He shot himself in the foot, if you will, by announcing his presidential campaign on the very night of a very important debate here. But he didn't do it here. He did it in California. He did it on the Jay Leno Show. That and several other reasons made it pretty hard for him to compete here in New Hampshire. What we are told instead of doing that is they have sent pretty much all of the resources they have left, all of the staff and the supporters, they have all gone down to South Carolina. Fred Thompson is, of course, a former senator from Tennessee. They are hoping that his southern roots, his southern sensibility, will allow him to do OK there. An advisor to Fred Thompson, they are calling it going Custor. They are referring to, of course, Custor's last stand back in the Civil War, and the battle of little big horn. But the problem if you remember, Suzanne, Custor didn't make it past that land stand. He died in that battle. It's an interesting analogy for Fred Thompson's campaign. That's what they are calling their strategy. They are going to South Carolina and hoping to pull off some frankly a miracle there and that's why you are not seeing him campaign here in New Hampshire. You will see him at tonight's debate."", 'And we have time from a quick question. What do you think is the big issue in his campaign that they are trying to push for and promoters to get a sense of who he is as a candidate?', ""Experience, experience, experience, experience. I was with him in Iowa. He did a 50-city bus tour there. I was with him at the beginning of it. He was there through the Iowa caucuses and you heard him essentially say, if you have a president sitting across the table from your enemy, you want me there. He sort of delivering lines, the actor delivering lines, and he thinks people want to hear, want to see from a president. That has been the thing he's tried to get across and he is somebody you can trust in the driver's seat. You can have somebody who can trust with basically your finger on the button. But the problem that he faced and that was evident in what happened in Iowa, is that he just didn't really inspire voters that he really believed that he wanted to be president. And that was a big problem for Fred Thompson, and it's been a big problem since his late entry into this race in the fall and it certainly continues to be. We will see what happens in South Carolina. We will have much, much more of the BALLOT BOWL continuing in a moment. Stay with us."", ""Welcome back to the CNN BALLOT BOWL. I'm John King coming to you live from Bedford, New Hampshire. Three days of campaigning before the crucial New Hampshire presidency primary, the first primary in the presidential process coming just five days after the leadoff caucuses out of the state of Iowa. Those caucuses rejiggered both the Democratic and Republican races for president. Barack Obama winning on the Democratic side. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee winning on the Republican side. The candidates not only out-campaigning here in the state of New Hampshire today. There you see them, Edwards, Clinton, Romney, Obama, McCain, and Huckabee. Others out campaigning for the nominations at a very busy and crucial weekend in the state of New Hampshire out campaigning. Also inside debating tonight. Jessica Yellin, part of the best political team on television, joins us from the side of one of tonight's debates. Jessica, if you had to say there's one candidate who has the most -- the most at stake, it would be?"", ""It would be Hillary Clinton. You know it, John. Tonight she has to do something to make herself stand out, to define herself and give her a victory here in New Hampshire. Just over three days from today. You know, they expected to have a tough race in Iowa. There was no expectation that Obama would come out so far ahead of her in Iowa. The fact he had -- his campaign is calling it a dominating win. Her campaign would call it disappointing but not fatal. They don't have that long to make her come ahead, to make her pull ahead here in New Hampshire. And with this compressed schedule, there's a new urgency for her to do something that will give her the edge that Obama currently has. So all eyes are going to be on her tonight to see what she says, what she does, what her tone will be, to help differentiate her and the trick for Hillary Clinton tonight will be to do that, to say she's the candidate with more experience, she's the candidate who, for example, on health care has, in her view, a more comprehensive plan, a more Democratic plan, without sounding negative. And the challenge will be how negative does she go? How can she go negative? Barack Obama's people insisting they expect her to go very negative will hit back. That's a lot of spin. Today so far she's not gone negative on Obama on the trail but who knows what happens tonight. John."", ""Spin in politics, Jessica, I can't believe it. After the Iowa caucuses, we saw two of the Democrats depart the stage. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware, both stepping aside and bowing out of the race after they were unable to break through. Other long shot candidates in the race, among them Governor Bill Richardson. What are the stakes for Governor Richardson as the campaign goes forward?"", ""Richardson right now is still campaigning hard. His big issue is the Iraq war. All along he maintained he's the one who has the most experience and most sort of clearest thinking on Iraq with the real plan and that's the thing he's been hammering home here in New Hampshire. And expect to hear from him on the debate tonight. His campaign staff, some of them was laid off after Iowa, a sign of paring down, saving resources. But his campaign folks are saying he's ready for the long fight. He thinks the lack of so many with Biden and Dodd out of the race that gives Richardson more oxygen to be heard. And so we will certainly hear from him significantly tonight. He's quite the talker, as you know. But we can probably take a listen to some of what he's been saying on the campaign trail. This is Richardson talking about the Iraq war."", ""I want to just say how privileged it is to run for president. Because all around the country people want to be inspired. They want us to come together as a nation. The partisanship and dysfunctional relationship that exists between the president and Congress, American people want good government. They want unity. They want us to resolve the huge problems of the middle class today that are straining over wages that are not keeping up with inflation, foreclosures that have claimed over 2 million homes, pensions that are not protected, college loans that burn young people for years and years, preventing them from buying a home or starting a business. And then jobs that go overseas with the trade policy in this country today that has a wonder our trade deficit goes to pay off $96 per barrel oil. And so you see this anxiety, but at the same time you see a lot of people wanting change. But they want to have that change to get it done. What our campaign is is change and experience. You can't change this country without experience. You got to know how to do it. You got to know how to go."", 'Yes.', 'You got to know how to bring people together.', 'Yes.', ""You got to be bipartisan. You have to have solutions. Solution that's work. And all my life, all my life as a hostage negotiator, as something who brought cease-fires in countries together and talked to the world's worst people. I like to say my speech to President Clinton, and here's what he said to me, bad people like presidents. And so that is the emphasis of an American that wants us to be respected internationally. We are going to do it with diplomacy, not with war. We are going to do it by becoming, again, a community of nations. And I'm an elected president; I will follow the constitution of the United States. When I'm elected president, we will also bring back Habeas Corpus to our legal system. If I'm elected president, we will not eavesdrop on our own citizens. When I'm elected president, we will not use torture. When I'm elected president, we will follow the Geneva Convention society. When I'm elected president, we will sign the global treaty. When I'm elected president, we will have a government that will reflect the will of the people. And I want to just conclude with what this campaign is all about, and what we are going to be raising all over the country. And that is the fundamental issue affecting America today is ending the war and bringing our entire troop's home!"", 'Well, john, he got to Iraq there towards the end. Quite an enthusiastic crowd for him. I have to say, on the campaign trail, even when you go to Obama events and Clinton events, there are quite a number of people who say they are considering Richardson because they really do like his position on the Iraq war. The big challenge for Richardson is economic issues have overcome Iraq in many quarters of this country in the Democratic field as a top issue. Iraq not as dominating a concern for many democratic voters as it once was. Richardson has found his way to supporters and keeps chucking along in New Hampshire. No doubt he will hit on his Iraq theme. John.', 'Jessica Yellin, an excellent point. He started talking about exclusively about Iraq on the Democratic side but more and more the economy, health care and domestic issues taking precedence in an ever-changing and ever-volatile campaign. The CNN BALLOT BOWL will continue. Today the candidates in their own words, the Democrats and the Republicans. When we return here, more from the big winner. And now the man at the front of the Democratic pack, junior senator from Illinois, the man who hopes to become the United States first African- American president. We will hear from Barack Obama and others when the CNN BALLOT BOWL continues in just a minute.', 'Coming up at the top of the hour, Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton are trying to make their respected cases to New Hampshire voters. What are they saying? We will get with them just minutes from now. But first every four years the presidential candidates trudge through the New Hampshire snow to honor a tradition. Eating and chatting with voters at the Merimax (ph) Cafe in New Hampshire. Barack Obama stopped by after an invitation from our affiliate WMUR.', ""Hi, guys, this is one of the most fun events on my schedule. What schedule, what I was told, we don't have a firm, set agenda."", ""That's right."", ""We can just talk about anything you want except the Red Sox because I'm a White Sox fan. I congratulate them. That's all I want to say about it. I'm married to Michelle, who is spectacular. I thought, I like this. So I asked her out, and she said, I can't. I'm your advisor. I said, this isn't serious, you're not -- you know, evaluating me or supervising me. We can go out. She said no, no, that won't be appropriate. So they started setting me up with some of her friends. Which none of them were interesting at all to me? But I wore her down. I had two daughters, Malie and Sasha, who are 9 and 6 years old. They are above average. Exactly, Exactly. Which is, by the way, the hardest thing about running for president. The saddest thing, I used to worry about them. Now I realize I'm the one in pain all the time. They are like, daddy; we're having a great time here. You're in the hotel room. Eating your cold take-out food so they are having a ball."", 'Describe your daughters to us.', ""Malea, the older one, is -- she's like an old soul. She's one of these kids who from a very early age was just real wise. The older one's temperament is much more like me. Where as the younger one is more like Michelle. I mean, she's much more stubborn, much more, you know, Michelle will acknowledge this. Shorter fuse. And so my mother-in-law will say that our younger one is just like Michelle was. I think when you grow up without a dad in the house, sometimes you -- you project sort of, OK, what kind of man should I be? I was lucky enough, my mom, even though they divorced, always told me how smart he was and how he had gone back to Kenya and was involved in government. So I got this image in my head. It turned out later; the image wasn't really accurate, that he was a troubled man. So part of it was living up to the image that wasn't there to dispel the image. My mom thought I was the greatest man in the world and that can make up for other stuff. If you have one person who thinks you're just the bomb."", 'In high school, were you like Lois Clever or more like Eddie Haskell?', 'I was definitely the bad kid. I was always confident but I was a goof, all the way up through high school.', 'How do you stay normal and humble? You have to use little tricks to do it. I know you do.', ""I am reminded every day of my imperfections. And I think that -- I tend to learn more -- I am one of these people who tend to listen more to -- to criticism than I am somebody who laps up the adulation. I am always saying how I could have done this better or that didn't make sense and why did I say that? That was kind of a boneheaded thing to say."", ""And I'm an Oprah fan. You watch Oprah every day, obviously?"", 'Taught me a couple of things.', ""Are you going to utilize Oprah in the campaign in some way? Is she going to do what she's done for let's say literacy and books and getting people interested? She definitely has that forum."", ""I'm not a book or hand lotion or something that I can be marketed like that."", 'I understand.', ""But one of the things I'm pleased with is she -- I think like a lot of people -- have not been interested in politics."", ""That's right."", ""Or have been cynical about politics. And I have been able to maybe make them feel like this might be something worthwhile. They will not vote for me just because Clooney says vote for me. But they will come out, see?

The news is unfolding live on this Saturday. It is the very first day of March. Hello, everybody. I'm Betty Nguyen."", ""Good morning to you, I'm T.J. Holmes. This is the first day of March madness. We're not talking NCAA basketball here on the hard court. We're talking about the hard knocks playing out in the political arena. For the Democrats, it's anybody's game, but for Republicans, it's another story."", 'From the ad wars to the ongoing name game, and of course, who is saying what about Iraq? All of it this hour in the CNN NEWSROOM. Well, you know the campaigns are caffeinated, voters, they are buzzed, and we have you covered. Three days to go to pressure- padded primaries in Ohio and Texas. The states could finally decide the winner of the Clinton Obama drama.', ""CNN, home of the best political team on television. Count on our veterans to keep you in the know in the run-up to Tuesday's critical contest. Our correspondents and analysts are in place to bring you the numbers, issues, the polls, the voters. Hillary Clinton, of course, the candidate, some are saying has the most to lose on Tuesday. She's suggesting you have a lot to lose as well. A blistering TV ad questions Obama's crisis leadership. We'll show you those ads. Clinton is campaigning across Texas today. She's dispatched her husband and daughter to Ohio."", ""Barack Obama is in Rhode Island today. He's responding to the Clinton ad with one of his own. He's also enjoying a new endorsement from a key senate colleague. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, John McCain is confident enough to spend a day at home in Arizona. He's taking new fire after he accepted the endorsement of an apocalyptical preacher."", ""The opponents, Mike Huckabee on the Republican side, he is not giving up, despite being way behind in the delegate count. He's staying on the campaign trail in Texas, even though he has virtually no chance of catching McCain in that delegate count. Well, four states vote on Tuesday, Texas, Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont, 370 Democratic delegates on the block, 256 Republicans, enough for McCain to nail down that GOP nomination. So of course, you can see with all those numbers just how important Tuesday really is. We have some new numbers here to share with you. Take a look. The poll of polls for Ohio, Hillary Clinton leads with 47 percent of the vote. Barack Obama has 40 percent. There's still 13 percent who say they are unsure. We have, of course, seen large numbers of voters deciding in the final three days before casting their ballots in previous primary elections."", ""And here's the even tighter race right now, Texas. Obama leads the poll of polls with 48 percent, Clinton has 44 percent, and again, there are enough undedecideds to tip this race either way, and that has led both candidates to launch new ad campaigns. Here's a look at Hillary Clinton's ad."", ""It's 3:00 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep. But there's a phone in the White House and its ringing. Something is happening in the world. Your vote will decide who answers that call. Whether it's someone who already knows the world's leaders, knows the military, someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world. It's 3:00 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep, who do you want answering the phone?"", ""I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message."", ""All right. So that ad playing on the experience angle. That's been a big part of Hillary Clinton's message to voters."", ""Well, now take a look at Barack Obama's ad, a direct response to that Clinton commercial."", ""It's 3:00 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep, but there's a phone ringing in the White House. [ ringing ] Something's happened in the world. When that calls gets answered, shouldn't the president be the one, the only one, who had judgment and courage to oppose the Iraq war from the start, who understood the real threat to America was al Qaeda in Afghanistan, not Iraq, who led the effort to secure loose nuclear weapons around the globe. In a dangerous world, it's judgment that matters."", ""I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message."", ""Ok, so now that you've seen both ads, let's talk about primary colors, because racial lines are expected to play a major part in Tuesday's primary in Texas. And for the Democrats, long-standing racial tensions could add to the drama. CNN's Suzanne Malveaux explains."", ""In Texas, where black and Hispanic voters are critical to a big win, a dust-off. A prominent Hispanic supporter of Senator Hillary Clinton hurls a loaded charge, that Obama's problem with Hispanics, his race."", 'Obama simply has a problem that he happens to be black.', 'The 84-year-old Latina activist Mrs. Adelfa Callejo says the divisions between blacks and Latinos run deep in Dallas.', ""When the blacks had the numbers, they never did anything to support us. They always talk -- they used our numbers to fulfill their goals and their objectives, but they never really supported us, and there's a lot of hurt feelings about that, and I don't think we're going to get over it any time soon."", ""Before being fully briefed about Callejo's comments, Senator Clinton was asked if she rejected or denounced the leader's support."", ""People have every reason to express their opinions. I just don't agree with that."", 'But later, after Clinton\'s campaign verified the details, they issued a statement, saying, ""After confirming that they were accurately portrayed, Senator Clinton, of course, denounces and rejects them.""', 'I would reject and denounce --', ""Those words, denounces and rejects, were used by Senator Barack Obama in Tuesday night's debate. When he tried to distance himself from past anti-Semitic comments made by the leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, who has since endorsed Obama. But this controversy underscores the sensitive nature of Texas politics."", 'In Texas, Latinos and African-Americans are the two warring once minority groups.', 'With warring political candidates, analysts say Hispanics lining up for Clinton, African-Americans for Obama.', 'Pretty much saying that African-American and Hispanic voters will be about even.', ""But while there may be some tension between the groups, Professor Christine Leveaux-Haley says it's being exaggerated to get Hispanic voters to the polls."", 'There might be some need to kind of mobilize the Latino vote or galvanize Latinos around some type of issue, and that just might be this divide between Latinos and African-American voters.', ""All right, let's go ahead and bring in our Paul Steinhauser standing by. Paul, our deputy political director out of D.C. this morning. After seeing that piece there, are there any signs that in Texas this is really gaining a lot of traction or making some kind of a difference from before? We always knew there was kind of a split where blacks were going for Obama and Latinos for Hillary Clinton, but after the comments by Ms. Callejo there, are we seeing that that's really a factor?"", ""Yeah, could be a factor. Blacks and Latinos are such a big deal when it comes to Texas and the Democratic primary. Latinos, as we've seen in the primary process, have really been backing Hillary Clinton, and CNN and the Opinion Research Corporation we took a poll last week and we found that about two-thirds of the Latinos in Texas are backing Clinton. We also polled African-Americans in Texas. About eight in 10 are backing Obama. So you can really see the stark differences there. And it's important, because you know, Latinos make up about a third of the population in Texas. African-Americans a little less, about 15 percent or 10 percent. But in big areas like Houston and Dallas, where there are a lot of Democratic delegates at stake, they are a major force. So this is going to be very crucial to the outcome on Tuesday night."", ""All right, let's go back to these ads now that are playing out. Hillary Clinton hit pretty hard, I suppose, on this ad she had out, who do you want answering that phone when there is a crisis at 3:00 in the morning. Is this a sign? Not necessarily desperation, but she's going at him a little hard. It's the same theme, really, we've seen during the campaign -- does he have the experience? But this is a little more biting than we've seen in the past."", ""Well, exactly, exactly. Same lines, or the same theme of experience she has that he doesn't. She's been using that for about a year now against him. But you're right, this is much more hardball politics. This is a tougher ad. The Clinton campaign says no, this is not a tough ad, it's not a nasty negative ad, but the Obama campaign, in fact Barack Obama himself yesterday came out and said this ad is intended to scare people to vote for her."", ""Is there any scenario that we could imagine on super Tuesday 2, it's being called now by some, on Tuesday, that she would get out of the race? Is there anything that can happen on Tuesday that would cause either one of them to step out of the race?"", ""Sure. You know, if she gets swept, you would assume that there's going to be intense pressure on her to get out. Even if she doesn't take both Texas and Ohio, which are the two more important, the bigger two states, there will be probably some pressure on her to get out. Her campaign, though, is saying something new in the last day. You know for a while now, we heard President Clinton, her husband, say that if she doesn't win Texas and Ohio, maybe that would be it for her, but now her campaign is saying if Barack Obama doesn't take all four states, including Vermont and Rhode Island, that the voters may have a little remorse and she would stay in. So T.J., anything could happen. Just stay tuned Tuesday night."", ""I certainly will. One last thing here, I guess you have to touch on the Republican side, not as much of a race going, since the major candidate has taken the weekend off. But Mike Huckabee made this statement and he said that, hey, I'm trying to take this to the convention. If I can just hold on and nobody gets enough delegates, I could go to the convention and then I could be the candidate because I'm the most conservative. Explain just quickly how, if it does go to the convention, how he could walk out of there being the candidate."", ""Well, first of all, he -- I mean, first of all, McCain could go over the top Tuesday night. That's a possibility. He's only about 150 delegates shy of the 1,191 needed, at about 250 delegates on the Republican side are up in those four states. So it could be over come Tuesday. But if it isn't -- if Huckabee has a strong night, does well in Texas and some of the other states, yes. If McCain never gets over the top, never to 1191, theoretically this thing could go to the convention and then they would have a series of votes. And if McCain didn't win in the first round, all of those delegates that were pledged to him would probably be freed up. This thing could go all the way. But you know, Huckabee's hoping. He said he's not a mathematician, he's a dreamer."", 'And he says he is a miracle man.', 'A miracle man.', 'If he pulls that off he is Mike ""the miracle"" Huckabee, for sure, from now on. Paul Steinhauser, we appreciate you as always, good to see you buddy.', 'Take care', ""Folks, we want to let you know, we're keeping an eye on an event happening in Lakewood, Ohio right now. Of course, we've got our eyes all over the campaign trail, but an event here, those people standing by waiting to hear from Bill Clinton to talk about his wife and the crucial contest coming up in Ohio. When that happens we will dip in and hear what the former president has to say."", ""Right now, the Iraq war is a key issue driving this political season, and CNN's John King talks with a voter who has a personal stake in the outcome."", ""Two and a half years now since the knock on John Dyer's door. The pain is constant. But some things have changed."", 'I do think in hindsight going into Iraq as we did was a huge mistake. I thought it sounded like it was necessary at the time.', ""Lance Corporal Christopher Dyer was 19. A father's grief shaped by his son's last call from the war zone."", ""They were worn out and there weren't enough of them."", ""Yet in Tuesday's Ohio primary and again in November, Dyer plans to vote for the candidate who insists things are improving in Iraq, and who insists the troops must stay."", ""It seems like we've shown a lot of progress and I don't think it's the time to quit and run. I think if we hadn't shown some progress it would be time to have called it a day."", 'Americans do see some progress. 46 percent say things are going well in Iraq, up from just 34 percent in November. But in that same CNN poll only 34 percent of Americans support the war, 63 percent oppose it.', ""I think I'm in a minority view. My friends and people who know me are obviously very guarded about talking to me about this for obvious reasons. But what I sense is people are just dog tired of this situation."", 'For McCain Ohio is a critical proving ground. No Republican has ever won the White House without carrying this state. Pollster Eric Rademacher says the unpopular war is a big factor in recent Democratic gains.', ""In 2006 independents moved over to the Democratic Party in Ohio and if there is a concern for the Republican candidate that's it."", ""Visiting an Ohio company that makes armored vehicles for the troops was part of McCain's sales pitch."", 'But we will never ever surrender and they will.', 'Dyer was already convinced but says checking the Obama and Clinton campaign websites recently made him more adamant.', ""I don't understand their position at all. I think we're already talking about bringing combat troops home. We're really talking about a difference in the pace at which we do that."", 'Do you ever worry that because you did pay a price and a very painful personal price that your judgment is clouded?', ""Yeah. Yeah. I could almost guarantee you my judgment is impacted by that. I try as hard as I can to separate my personal loss, and I know it's not really possible."", 'John King, CNN, Evansdale, Ohio.', ""So let's talk now about the candidates on Iraq. Where do they stand? CNN's Josh Levs is digging into their positions and he spells it out in their plans for the war at the half hour."", 'And you need to stay with CNN for the best political coverage on television.

Two other people are said to be in the hospital with severe burns. Ben Baird of Central Florida News 13 has more of what happened."", ""They were in the plane that was doing those low maneuvers. We're not sure at this point whether this accident was caused by pilot error or by a mechanical problem with the plane. However, we do know that when these two planes collided, one of the people in that plane that's doing those low maneuvers was partially ejected. The other person was still inside while the plane was on fire. A couple of bystanders actually came up and helped to get those people out of the plane before it was completely engulfed, and that's the only reason those folks are still alive at this point, but again, they are in what was called grave condition at ORMC."", ""Ok, we'll have more on this breaking news story as we get it, but just want to clarify something. We were told by our reporter there on the ground with the affiliate Florida News 13 that one of the planes was actually sitting on the tarmac when another one was coming in, presumably for landing. All of this is still being clarified. Then that's when the planes collided. So both of them weren't low-flying planes.

CNN-130607,ANDERSON COOPER 360 DEGREES,2008-9-13,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0809/13/acd.03.html,,More Coverage of Hurricane Ike Aftermath,"[""And you just can't believe that's even happening."", 'All right, Chad Myers, thank you very much as well. General Russell Honore, thank you very much as well. One other person said what happens to the people? Who pays for the people who are rescued? And you said to me...', ""That's the great part about being an American."", 'All right, there you go.', ""We'll come get you anywhere around the world if we know where you are."", 'Thanks to both of you. We appreciate you watching us this hour. I want to throw now to my colleague out in the field, Anderson Cooper. He continues our coverage of Hurricane Ike with a special edition of ""AC 360.""', ""And thanks very much, Don. We are live in Bridge City, Texas, just north of Port Arthur, Texas. And the water here tells the story. It is - goes as far as the eye can see, severe flooding here in Bridge City. We have seen rescue and evacuations throughout this day. People trapped on the top of the roofs of their homes since early morning hours. They thought they could ride out the storm. They found out they couldn't as the water started to surge and the winds started to howl. And there have been some dramatic rescues throughout the day. We're going to bring you that over this next two hours of our special coverage. We have correspondents fanned out throughout the Texas region in Bay City - Bayside, we have Ali Velshi, who's taking a look at the impact on oil refineries, Gary Tuchman, Rob Marciano. They are in Galveston, Texas tonight, where we have seen severe storm damage. Jeanne Meserve is in Houston, Texas as well for us. And Rick Sanchez is in a Coast Guard Air Station monitoring the rescue operations that had been going on throughout this day, as the storm winds finally decided they were starting to able to go out, try to survey the damage. Today, it is a day of rescue and recovery. Those are the two words we heard an awful lot about today. All throughout the next two hours, we're going to bring you some of the most dramatic moments. Also, the latest on that train crash in Los Angeles, what they now say caused that crash. More than 20 people confirmed dead. And the death toll at this point, it has just been horrific. We'll take you to the scene for that. Right now, let's go to Gary Tuchman, who is live in Galveston with Rob Marciano. Gary, what's the situation there?"", ""Well, Anderson, we had talked for the last couple of days about the National Weather Service warning that anybody who lived in one or two story homes near the beach and were a mile from the beach right now faced death. That's exactly what they said. They said they would die. The fact is the people who lived in these homes, many of them didn't stay. They didn't die. That doesn't mean it was a good situation. We've talked to one family who lived in a house on this block. And they told us - they made the decision to stay because they were concerned about valuables in their house. We hear that a lot. They stayed in the house and the water started coming in the house. First one foot, then two foot, then three foot. Then the eye came over Galveston. We all experienced that eye for like an hour. There was no winds at all. And then the worst part of the storm, the back half of it came in. Four feet of water. The family then decided to go into the attic, where they lived a terrifying evening for a few hours in their attic as the water continued to rise. They are now OK. Their house is a wreck. The water has receded. And they just told me a short time ago they would never do that again. The good news about the storm is that it does not appear at this point that there are any casualties. There are no reports of deaths here in Galveston where the eye crossed, no reports of injuries. But a really important point, look at this street. Scores of streets like this in Galveston, Texas, we've gone up and down this town. Streets under water. And the police have not had the opportunity to check all these homes. So we don't know for sure if the people in all these homes are OK. When I was talking to this family that rode it out, they said they really aren't sure. They think a couple of families stayed here, but there's no sign of anyone coming out of these homes. So we hope there are no casualties, but there are no guarantees. That was the warning that people could die. I'm telling you, Anderson, here in Galveston, it was an incredibly rough evening. We had 12 hours of torrential rains, 16 hours of tropical storm force winds and hurricane force winds. And at times, we had sustained winds of 100 miles per hour. There's intense damage all over this city, but the good news so far, no deaths. Anderson?"", 'Hey, I know it was frustrating for a lot of rescue personnel. They had folks calling 911 at the height of the storm on Galveston, saying come rescue me. Folks who had been told very clearly, look, you face certain death. Have you talked to those people? I mean, are - do they regret riding it out?', ""Right, we asked that question to authorities that did you talk to those people today? And they said they talked to people, that there were no casualties from those callers to 911. That's not the first time we've heard that. I mean, that's something we always hear during every hurricane that people decide at the last second to go. They call 911. Sometimes the authorities can go, but I will tell you at the heart of this last night, there was no physical way to get a car out safely on the road to help rescue someone. The people who were calling 911 during the middle of the storm, they had no option but to wait it out in their homes."", ""Gary, I just want to show our viewers some of the rescue personnel, the vehicles that have been coming through this water. They're able to drive on part of the road here. But just off to the side of the road, the water just gets incredibly deep. If I step back even a few more feet, I'd basically be up to my neck in water. And you see these things floating by. Here's a tire that just kind been floating by. It's kind of surreal to say the least. The house behind me, as far as we can tell, has been evacuated, but clearly, they have suffered some very extensive flooding. There's just flooding throughout this area. I also want to check in with Rob Marciano, who also rode out the storm on Galveston. He's there now. Rob, what have you been seeing today?"", ""Well, driving around, we've seen quite a bit of damage. And the frustrating part of what today brought is that there's still a lot of this town that is underwater. And officials can't get to the people their most feared about, particularly on the west side. The mayor today said well, pretty much the island is closed. They don't want anybody coming in. You're free to go out if you could dodge around all the debris. They're in recovery mode right now. They let the fire department out around 9:00 this morning once the winds died down enough so that it would be safe for them. And they went door to door searching homes to clear them, mark them, much like we've seen in other natural disasters, be them tornados or hurricanes. They only got through 42 structures. They did pull out 27 survivors out of those structures, and put them into shelters. No serious injuries with those folks. 17 of those structures completely collapsed. And there were 10 fires. So that added just another element of drama to this whole deal. But as Gary mentioned, zero fatalities right now. But I should point out that this is a 32 mile island that at mile marker 11 goes underwater. So basically, 20 miles west of here, they're underwater and they need for those water to recede before they can assess the situation completely and say - give the green light. Speaking of water, storm surge. Obviously, that's what brings the water in. I want to talk with Mark Sudit (ph). He's with Hurricane Track. Your specialty is putting boxes out and training video and taping video these storm surges where people don't want to be. How did it work out for you?"", ""Rob, it's a tough job. It worked out perfect in terms of the execution. Fortunately for the island, it wasn't a massive storm surge. We didn't get that huge inundation that bulldozed everything like we saw, at least not at this part of the island, where the sea wall is, like we saw in Katrina. The project worked. We're going to have to analyze what we captured on tape and on our laptop computers and take it from there. But it did work. And the - the idea of using that technology to put these cameras out where none of us have any business being and going and hunkering down somewhere safe as relative as possible, it worked. We'll have to see what the results are."", 'On the very spots you put out there, what was the most dramatic? And which one surprised you the most?', ""Well, the one that we placed at Bermuda Beach, that we haven't been able to get to yet, is the one that was the most dramatic. Of course, the one that we cannot get and show on the air right now is the most dramatic. That's the way it works. What surprised us the most, though, is the amount of water coming in to that sea wall. And the fact that it held, you're seeing that is definitely good news for Galveston."", ""All right, Mark Sudit, hurricanetrack.com. Thanks, Mark. He's been all on CNN, the street neck video. You probably saw it in some of our hurricane coverage. And of course, go to his website if you want to check it out more. Storm surge, a big deal, Anderson. When it came to this sea wall, protecting the city for almost 100 years. And it was put to the test with Ike. It was not breached. It was overtopped in some spots. It was damaged in some spots, but it did manage to protect the inner core of this city. But around that sea wall, obviously, we've got some water issues that may not subside for quite some time. Anderson?"", ""Yes, the good news here, the water - Rob, water is subsiding a little bit. I just want to walk over and just show our viewers. Also, meanwhile, we're still seeing paramedics, fire personnel, fish and wildlife folks in boats and pick-up trucks, monster trucks, taking people out of here. Injured people as well. We've seen just in the last couple minutes, a couple cars go by with people. We don't want to put a camera in their face just out of respect for them. But here's a - look at that pole right there. I don't know if you can zoom in on that. You see, the water level is about a foot and a half higher earlier today. So it is definitely going down here, but it has a long way to go before anyone is able to return to their homes. And there's no telling how long power is going to be out. There's some two and a - more than two and a half million people in the Houston area who are without power on this evening. And they have been told, and all day you've been hearing people talking about on radios, power could be out for weeks in a lot of parts of Texas. I want to check in with Chad Myers, who has been tracking the storm all night for us. Chad, you know, I think a lot of people watching this storm last night said you know what? It wasn't as bad as they thought it was going to be. What happened? Tell me the track of the storm."", ""The track went right over the tip of Galveston Island. And so that means from Galveston Island northward, to where you are, all the way into Louisiana, that was the bad side. That was the dirty side of the hurricane. And although we've gotten a lot of damage in downtown Houston and in glass is out, and power's out, and two million customers without power, the real damage was to the east of there, and relatively unpopulated, compared to living in Houston or having this thing make a direct hit on Houston. We still have tornados today. We still have some winds still coming on shore into Louisiana and Texas. So that's why the water's not coming back or going out. It's still kind of getting pushed in. It'll keep getting pushed in for the next few hours. By the time this goes away and gets up into Arkansas, finally, your wind will slacken it up that your water eventually, Anderson, will all go out there. You need to be careful in that water, though. There's some bad stuff in that water."", ""Yes, I don't know what an impact your world thing is. Yes, I don't know what - and Chad, at this point, it's now down to a tropical storm. How long are conditions going to be - I mean, how long is this water going to be here? Can - is there any way to tell?"", ""There isn't any way to tell. And it's a long, slow process for it to get back into the ocean, especially if it has to go back over barrier islands or kind of a little bit of a burham down south of where you are. And that's likely where those barrier islands are. It has to find its way out through some - through the jeddys and out through the shipping canals. It's not just all the way - it sloshes over the island, but it can't - doesn't slosh back into the ocean. It has to find its way through the cuts in the barrier island. And that's what it's doing now. I imagine the rush of water, through the cut, the jetty that is there in Galveston Island, between Galveston and Boliver (ph) Peninsula, I bet that water is rushing like you would never believe. It would be the world's worst rip current that you've ever seen right now."", ""Chad, we're going to check in with you throughout these two hours. I want to put on the screen a website for you, for impact your world for folks who are watching this and want to be able to make a difference and do something for the people here who are clearly going to be needing some help in the coming weeks and months, because this thing, the impact of this, I mean, the news media and a lot of people's attention moves on very quickly. For the people down here, this has been a devastating storm and the impact is going to be felt for a long time. So the impact your world website there, you can see it on the screen. Coming up, we're going to talk to Ali Velshi, who has been looking at the refinery situation. If you've tried to get some gas today, you might have noticed prices have risen already across the country. He'll explain why that's happened and how long that's going to be the case. Let's look at what's happened with refineries. A lot more to come here from the path of Hurricane Ike. We'll be right back."", ""We've been seeing rescue operations. The Governor Rick Perry of Texas said this is actually the largest rescue and recovery operation in Texas state history. If you drove down on the roads today, you saw National Guard vehicles, you saw Army vehicles, you saw paramedics, you saw firefighters from all over. They're sending folks up from San Antonio. We saw people here being rescued in monster trucks and pick-up trucks, anything they can. They got boats out here. There's some folks driving in right by on motorcycles. They're doing everything they can to try to get people out of here. We're looking at a Coast Guard rescue that took place yesterday. The Coast Guard has been out in force today. Rick Sanchez is at a Coast Guard Air station, who's been monitoring rescue efforts. Rick, what have you been hearing?"", ""Not only rescue efforts, Anderson. We're here at Ellington Air Reserve Base. I'm here in the hangar right now with all the Coast Guard rescue officials who have been literally, I'm watching them, walk in and out from the tarmac as they affect rescues. Let me say something like 60 rescues over the past 24 hours. What we have for you over the next hour and a half is segments of videos, showing not only rescues, but Coast Guard exclusive videos of some of the areas, like Freeport, for example, where you see home after home after home under water, where literally, the Gulf of Mexico itself has gone up into people's homes, rows of houses at least 10 or 11 deep. What I want to do for you now though is actually show you that video again that so many people talked about yesterday, the video of those six people being taken out of that truck. And I'm going to put on the phone for you right now Chief Petty Officer Al Shannon, who's joining us now to tell us or take us through what happened there. In fact, I should tell you, Anderson, the Chief Petty Officer Shannon is the one who first spotted these six people in this truck. I'm putting them on the phone for you now. Chief Officer Shannon, this is Anderson Cooper."", ""Hey, chief, thanks so much for joining us. Tell us a little bit about the rescue operation that we're seeing the video of. What happened?"", ""Well, I'm not actually looking at the video right now, so I don't know specifically which video you're looking at, but I know once we were in the first helicopter that was out there yesterday morning. And the final search had moved inland almost to the road, parallel to the beach. And a lot of vehicles were trapped along that roadway right there, trying to make their way off of Boulevard Peninsula. And as the waves got higher, it broke on the roadway, it was rolling vessels over and"", 'And', ""As far as today, it's not quite the same conditions as it was yesterday. Now, everything just seems to be flooded. There's - and most of the people that were in harm's way yesterday are not -- the amount of people in harm's way from yesterday were caught by surprise when they woke up that morning, to see that tidal surge already in their yard. Those people aren't there. They had a chance to - they've already a chance to be evacuated. Now, it's just the people who are trapped due to floodwaters, high floodwaters and what not."", ""Well, listen, we -- I know it's been a busy day for you. Appreciate you talking to us and appreciate all your efforts from you and everyone at the Coast Guard and all the folks we've seen out there today. It's been a remarkable effort and remarkable response. A lot of pre-staging and crews throughout Texas. A lot of prior preparation went into this. And it certainly showed today. So we appreciate you talking to us. We're going to talk to Ali Velshi, who has been watching from Baytown, Texas. He was there all night last night through the worst of the storm, watching the situation with oil refineries. Ali, what's the situation there now? And people are complaining gas prices have gone up all around the country."", ""Absolutely. In fact, we saw a jump of six cents overnight for a gallon of gas. That's a national average. That is one of the bigger jumps we've ever seen. We only saw bigger jumps right after Hurricane Katrina. Now we have an average expectation that gas prices are going to jump across the country maybe as much as 20 cents. In fact, in Tennessee, we've seen a jump of 27 cents. And there are isolated incidents of gouging around the country, over $5 for a gallon of gasoline. Now back behind me is the Baytown refinery, ExxonMobil's Baytown refinery. It's the biggest one on the continent, making about 570,000 barrels of oil into gasoline every day. It is shut down, along with about 13 other refineries in Texas. Texas is responsible for a quarter of all of the refining in the United States. So we are hearing from the oil companies now that they are starting to restaff some of these facilities. They are starting to have damage assessments. I took a drive around Baytown a few hours ago, didn't see any apparent flooding. It's a little bit higher than the ground that we're on right now. So it was pretty safe, but there are still issues with no oil coming into the refineries, and nothing going out of those refineries, distribution centers. The oil companies are saying that they are working very hard to get their distribution centers and their tankers out to gas stations. If there are gas stations without power, the oil companies and distributors are trying to get generators to those stations. So they want to get everybody at least in this part of the country getting gasoline to those stations. And we have started to see some of them open. Also, Anderson, Baytown is a bit of an oil town. But there are a lot of people who live here. And there was some serious damage to the town. We earlier went around and we saw some serious flooding. It's still here. This is the entrance from the bay into the Houston ship channel. And we definitely saw a lot of flooding around here. We also saw a lot of trees down. We talked to a gentleman earlier, who had a tree land, a big 90 foot oak right on his house. We saw a lot of damage, but we are keeping an eye on that and the oil situation. We'll know more in about 24 hours when the oil companies and the Department of Energy have had a look. One more thing, Anderson. The Department of Energy has set up a website. And they have asked people if they think that they have been subject to gouging or they're looking at gouging. You know, they think that a particular station is gouging, they should send information to this website. And I'm just going to give that to you. The website name is www.gaswatch.energy.gov, gaswatch.energy.gov. The government is taking this very seriously. They say it's not the right thing to do, to be gouging people in this time of need. Anderson?"", ""I think there are a lot of people right now who would tell you that there's gouging not just today, but been gouging going on a long time at the pump. And I guess that's certainly a matter of opinion. Ali Velshi, thanks. We'll check in with you again. We are on for the next - throughout these next two hours to give you a full update on the storm. But we also want to get you updated on the breaking news story out of the Los Angeles area, that deadly train crash that we saw last night. It happened around 6:00 p.m. East coast time last night. We were following it all during the evening. It is just -- the video is just horrific. Firefighters literally crawling on the wrecked gnarled train, trying to get people out, trying to find the living, trying to recover the dead. More than 20 people have died. We'll give you an update on that when we return."", ""And you're looking at pictures of this deadly train crash in Texas - excuse me, in Los Angeles that occurred last night. Of all the horrific things that can happen, I mean, a train crash is among the worst. Huge chunks of steel. Bodies strewn everywhere mixed with the steel. It is very difficult for rescue workers. We're going to talk to a representative of the L.A. County Sheriff's Department in a moment. But first, I want to talk to Ted Rowlands, who is covering this deadly train crash all night last night. The death toll is now, I believe, past 21. Let's confirm that with Ted. What's the death toll? What's the situation?"", ""Well, Anderson, a few moments ago, we just got an update. And the death toll right now stands at 24. And as horrible as that is, it's actually good news. And we also picked up from the L.A. County folks here, they have pulled the last body, they believe, out of the wreckage. And they just announced it moments ago. This morning, they were expecting it could have been much worse. This was a bi-level, a two-level train. And this morning, they started the grim task of getting to that second level. And at that point, they weren't sure what they were going to find."", ""Because of the wreckage and the way this engine has kind of gone into one of the cars, it may be that these numbers -- and it's very likely that these numbers will grow."", ""We've recovered the ones on the top, the ones that have been removed by the fire, the personnel. But now we've got to go step by step and work on the lower car and the surrounding area."", ""More than 130 of the estimated 220 on board the commuter train were injured. More than 40 of them critically. Overnight, as crews pulled bodies from the wreckage, people waited for word on loved ones that they couldn't contact. For a few moments overnight, rescuers stood silent as the body of an off-duty L.A. police over was lifted out, killed like most of the other victims, on her way home from work. The commuter train originated in downtown Los Angeles, and was headed northwest. At the point of the collision, there's a stretch of single shared track. Authorities are still investigating. But at this point, officials believe the engineer of the commuter train somehow missed a warning signal that a freight train was coming in the opposite direction."", 'We believe that it was our engineer who failed to stop at a signal.', 'Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger toured the site this afternoon, praising rescue workers and offering condolences to the victims and their families.', ""I just met the family of one of the officers that died in this accident here. And so it's a very, very tragic situation. It's one of the worst train accidents in modern history in California."", 'The condition inside the lead train car is being described as horrific. Rescue crews are vowing, though, to keep working around the clock until every victim is removed.', ""We believe the likelihood of anybody being alive in the wreckage at this point is very remote, but we do continue to remove victims. And as you can imagine, with the wreckage, it's been very, very difficult work, but the firefighters and police officers have just done a great job. And I'm very proud of them."", ""And you can hear the emotion in the fire chief's voice there, really indicative of the emotion surrounding this entire area, a horrific scene. A lot of people pitched in, including civilians, to try to help these people out. But the wounds here are going to take a long, long time to heal. The NTSB has officially now taken over this investigation. As to a cause at this point, they say they're just beginning it. They do have eyewitness testimony because four of the workers on the two trains are still alive. The engineer on the Metro Lake train that was believed to have missed a signal did die, but the others are alive and they do have recording devices on both of the trains that they'll analyze to figure out exactly what happened here. Anderson?"", ""Ted Rowlands, I know it's been a long, gruesome night for you. We appreciate your reporting on this. We also received a number of ireports from - I believe the one we're about to show you from Matt Hartman. These were taken just moments after the train crash. Obviously, rescue personnel are on the scene there. But these are these - the ireports that viewers sent to us. And we always ask people, you know, do not take any risk to yourselves, especially during a storm, to send us these. But clearly, after this train collision, Matt was able to take these photographs and really gives you a sense just of the - not only the quick response, but just the amount of activity, trying to save whoever could be saved inside that car. Steve Whitmore with the L.A. County Sheriff's Department, we talked to him a lot last night, even at the height of the storm about what was going on. We asked him to come back to talk to us tonight. He joins us now. Steve, tell us a little bit, if you can, what it was like for these rescue personnel working in these conditions? I can't imagine a more grueling, gruesome task."", 'Well, the last 22 hours, everybody, all hands on deck, were peeling apart those cars. As you know, the Metrolink engine was pushed back into the Metrolink car. And they worked thoroughly and meticulously to check every single person, to check every single corner that they could possibly find. It was long, it was focused. But now, it has ended. It is officially being turned over to the National Transportation Safety Board. And so, they will take over this operation as it moves forward.', ""It was obviously a solemn scene. And I know they found the body of an L.A. police officer. And I'm told when he was removed, he was flanked by several of his fellow officers. There were just so many moments, so many terrible scenes last night. Have you seen anything like this before?"", ""Well, it's been a -- it's been a most difficult two days. And it has had its special tragedies. It certainly is a tragedy of historic proportions. But it must be noted that in this tragedy, there have been heroes. There have been many heroes. There have been civilians on the train that tried to help those who could not help themselves. One of our own deputy sheriffs who experienced severe injuries used his radio until he couldn't use it, then instructed a passenger nearby to use it for him, and told him how to use it. And then he tried to continue help until he couldn't help any further. So there was many heroes involved in this, not only the firefighters, the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the fire departments ad infinitum, the agencies that were involved in this. The 24 that are lost, we'll never ever forget. And our thoughts and prayers go to their families. The operation now to notify, to identify, and to notify."", ""Steve Whitmore, well said. And we certainly echo those sentiments and those thoughts and prayers. And we want to thank you again for taking the time to speak with us today, especially also to talk about the heroism of the passengers and also rescue personnel. And we have seen heroism as well here throughout the state of Texas and Louisiana, where there was severe flooding as well, which we want to talk about in these next two hours as well. But in Bridge City, where I am right now, I mean, the water tells the story. As far as the eye can see right now, we're about two miles actually outside of Bridge City. And there is just water topping - you know, coming to close to the tops of mailboxes just all the way down this road. And it stretches basically as far as the horizon in the opposite direction as well. We have seen a lot of people being taken out today in boats, taken out. They spent the night on the roofs of their buildings, their one level homes. They thought they could ride out the storm. Some people said they couldn't get out because they couldn't afford to. There have been some rescue personnel who have said you know what, that's not really the case. But whatever the reason they stayed behind, they have been reached today. And again, the kind of heroism that we saw in Los Angeles on that train, we've been seeing an awful lot of that right here in Bay City and in Galveston and in points all around this area. We want to -- when we come back, we're going to check in with Chad Myers, who going to have you an aerial view of some of the worst areas of flooding, and also going to check in with Sean Callebs, who partially rode out the storm with me in Houston last night. But he'll also give us a sense of where some of the most badly affected areas are. Our coverage continues from the path of Hurricane Ike. We'll be right back."", ""And welcome back. We are on the outskirts of Bay City. You can see water starting to recede a little bit. There's the telephone poles about a foot and a half to two feet lower than it was earlier today. That is certainly a good sign. But if you look on our camera, you can see a long line of emergency vehicles just kind of waiting. They may be heading back down into some of the worst hit areas around Bay City just to see what's going on. But we have seen rescue vehicles going back and forth all day long, and still finding people, still bringing people out, bringing people out in the back of pick-up trucks, bringing people out in dump trucks. It's also, you were seeing pets roaming around. Hey, come here. You all right? There's a lot of dogs just kind of roaming around here. I'm not sure if they belong to somebody, if they belong to any of the rescue personnel. But that dog clearly has a collar on, so he belongs to somebody. A lot of people - and you know, we saw that in Katrina, of course, a lot of people not wanting to evacuate because of their pets. You know, shelters have taken care of that. Now they learned that lesson from Katrina, but a lot of people here just chose to ride out the storm. And frankly, they're paying the price for it right now, because they are still need to be rescued. And it looks like all those vehicles, which had been kind of stationed where the floodwaters ended, it looks like they are now slowly going to go en masse through these floodwaters and try to see what they can see. I see a number of fire personnel, fire trucks. We'll try to find out exactly where they are going. We haven't seen this long a line of emergency vehicles in this area at this point. So clearly, there is still work to be done in this area. Want to -- they are heading towards Bridge City, I've just been told. I want to check in with Jeanne Meserve, as we watch this scene here, I want to check in with Jeanne Meserve, who is in Houston. Some 2.5 million people without power right now. A lot of glass flying through the streets. You know, Jeanne, you and I were very close to the Chase tower last night. We were watching it all night long. It got hit hard in Hurricane Rita. I didn't see it this morning. How did it do?"", ""Well, I'll tell you, Houston is wasting no time putting itself to rights, Anderson. You look back here, you can see a street sweeper. There have been three or four of them doing runs up and down this street. In about half an hour, they have picked up a lot of the glass that came out of the Chase tower. We can take a look at that. You can see on this side, virtually every window out of this building, up to about 30, 38 stories, really did a number here. But as we pan down, you can see again one of these street sweepers, coming right on by, picking it all up just as fast as they can. This, of course, wasn't the only building in Houston that suffered damage. There also was a motel that lost its roof. People who were staying there said about 2:30, or 3:00 in the morning, they heard this loud noise and felt like they were being sucked out of their bed. Here's what one eyewitness had to say about the experience."", 'We were freaking out.', 'You can imagine the feeling.', 'Yes.', ""It's..."", '...more than freaking out. Beyond freaking out. They were crying in the bathtub.', 'We can feel the...', 'And...', ""I saw my daughter is crying. That's terrible. That's terrible."", ""Yes, but at least we're all alive."", ""And there were a lot of trees down all over this city. Even the mayor said he had a couple down, one across his deck. There was flooding here. I just went down and checked on the flooding that was near here. That's gone down considerably since this morning. There's worry about the water system here. The pressure was very low. The mayor was concerned that it might become contaminated. He asked residents to please use bottled water, keep their taps closed in order to keep the pressure up as much as they could. That's the situation there we're very much last watching. But at last report, there were no reports of deaths or serious injuries here in Houston, just the spectacular kind of damage that we see behind us. Anderson, back to you."", ""All right, Jeanne, we're going to check in with you in the next hour. We so far had, I believe, four deaths total, our reports are four deaths total. One little boy was killed in advance of the storm while his folks were trying to cut down trees in their yard. Apparently a tree fell on him. Just a terrible, terrible event. Governor Rick Perry joins us now. Governor, how is your state doing at this hour?"", ""Well, we're making do. A lot of folks have been rescued since early this morning. Some 950 rescues have occurred since we've been able to penetrate back in on the backside of this, with the largest search and rescue operation this state has ever seen. So I would suggest to you that although we've had a very good operation to date, from the aspect of evacuation, and you know, we still have people we have to deal with. And our focus is on saving those lives and those first responders, the Texas military forces, Texas task force 1 and Task Force Ike, along with the local law enforcement and search and rescue people doing a fabulous job of addressing the issue of individuals..."", ""We're watching in Bridge City some operations right now, a long line of rescue personnel heading toward Bridge City through this floodwater. What are the areas of greatest concern to you? Obviously, Galveston, clearly..."", 'Well, Orange and...', '...around Orange...', ""..yes, Orange and Port Arthur are two of the areas that really hard hit. They were on the side of the hurricane where you had some really substantial surges. So low-lying. And - but again, Galveston Island, a great concern. Partly because you had too many people in our estimation that didn't heed the warning of the local officials and stayed there."", ""Are you concerned? You know, with Hurricane Gustav, we had some dire predictions. We had a very dire prediction with this one. You know, National Weather Service saying certain death if you remain in Galveston in one or two story homes. Are you worried -- a lot of people didn't heed that warning on Galveston. Are you worried that there's sort of a hurricane fatigue, that people are just kind of don't believe the warnings anymore?"", ""Well, I think it's just the free will of individuals who live in a free country that make those decisions. And you can tell them and you can tell them. I don't know how you can get more dire than if you stay on the island, you will face certain death. Fortunately, this storm did not reach the level that could have made that a very poignant statement. But the fact of the matter is you're always going to have people that don't take that advice and think they're bullet proof."", 'And at this point, what do you want folks around the country who are watching this to know about what your state needs right now?', ""Well, I think the state is handling the needs. They're working really well with our federal counterparts, FEMA, and the Corps of Engineers, obviously, very important when it comes to recovery side of it. I talked to the president this morning in his office, a number of times since then. So it appears that all of our needs are being met from the standpoint of nobody's a miracle worker out there. The fact of the matter is Texas sustained a catastrophic event in one of the largest cities in the world. It's going to take a while to get electricity back, but we've seen some miracle working out of the state operation center. Jack Holly and Steve Mccraw have done a fabulous job down there getting some electricity pushed back on in Houston, so that they get their water supply working. And that's been some -- frankly, miracle working. So we'll continue on. And people can keep us in their prayers. That's the best thing they can do right now because search and rescue is still ongoing. And that's the biggest focus that we have right now. Recovery will happen. And it'll happen in a very short time frame. But you know, Texans are very resilient folks. And we'll get this taken care of. And I know our federal counterparts will be there to help us."", 'Governor Rick Perry, appreciate your time this evening.', 'Thanks, Anderson. So long.', ""We've been looking at live pictures of Houston, aerial shots. Also, you saw Reliant Stadium earlier. That sustained some damage, but these are live aerial shots of Houston. And again, we saw - we heard it so much last night, breaking glass, shattering glass, falling into the streets. You really didn't want to be out in those streets. And that was a concern early on because you saw people kind of walking around, not taking it too seriously. But again, even though the winds maybe weren't as high as some people thought they might be, it was that breaking glass that was of real concern. We have a lot more coverage ahead this evening and throughout much later into the evening as well. When we come back, what the candidates today said about the storm here. We'll hear from Barack Obama, John McCain, and Governor Sarah Palin. All that ahead. Stay tuned."", ""And welcome back. We are in the Bridge City area in Texas. You see the house there behind me, I actually wanted to kind of walk over to that house. It's kind of, you know, to see how badly it was flooded. I can't actually even get over there. If I took about two more steps behind me, I would basically sink up to my neck in water. And though that make something fun to watch on youtube, I don't really want to star on youtube in that way. We want to check in with Sean Callebs. He rode a good part of the storm in Houston. And all day today, he has been driving all along, from Laporte to now in Keenan, Texas to kind of get an overall sense of the lay of the land. Sean, what have you found today?"", 'Yes, Anderson, we left Houston early this it morning. And really just even getting out of the town with the on ramps to the interstates flooded or blocked in some areas, it felt like that movie ""Escape from New York."" Just trying to get out was kind of a nightmare. It took us about an hour to get out of the city. Then once we get out of the interstate, 45 south to Galveston was fine. A lot of debris on it, but still a lot of traffic. Boy, when we got into this area where the Galveston Bay is, Laporte, Seabrook,. Clear Lake, Kemah. Just look behind me. I\'m going to step out of the way. We\'re broadcasting via broadband, so the picture\'s not going to be that phenomenal, but you can see all of this debris. If you look back through there, you find appliances, furniture, people\'s silver. Of course, those items. But then there\'s those things that mean so much more, like an old wedding invitation, years and years old that\'s framed, a World War II era photograph. I\'m reminded of what parts of Mississippi looked like after Hurricane Katrina came in with that massive storm surge. And also, there\'s these gigantic concrete barriers over there that have just been blown out. Galveston Bay is usually very far to my left. We\'re basically at the bottom of a bridge that separates the town Kemah from Seabrook. Well, the bay has swept all the way in. And it is connected with Clear Lake. It has flooded a massive area. Authorities here with the city and state, there are floodgates nearby. They\'re trying to get those floodgates raised. They hope that by doing that, maybe they can release some of the pressure. But you know, this flooding, Anderson, is just so widespread, I really -- it\'s hard to imagine this water\'s going to go down anytime soon. We\'ve seen a great deal of debris., a great deal of flooding all along the area. We were back in areas under mandatory evacuation. A lot of homes are simply boarded up. There were gigantic trees that had been dropped everywhere. What really hits you with this storm is the sheer size of the devastation from Galveston well up past Houston area, probably close to 70 miles. That storm Ike was a monster churning around in the Gulf, but it really did its worse as it carved its way up through this area. You know, we\'ve heard people talk about they\'re going to be without power for perhaps weeks on end. It\'s certainly easy to believe. We\'ve talked to a number of law enforcement entities here today that have really been pushed to the limit. These people are exhausted. And really, they haven\'t begun to scratch the surface to try and clean all this up, Anderson.', ""All right, Sean Callebs, appreciate that. You know, the damage to power I heard on the radio today may be worse than it was during Hurricane Rita. And again, just the notion of people reacting. You heard a lot on talk radio today here in Texas. People reacting that they're going to have to wait weeks in some cases in order to get their power back. It's going to be a long recovery. But as the governor said just a short time ago, the focus really today in a lot of areas is still rescue operations. And we've been seeing that all along here in Bridge City. When we come back, we're going to hear what John McCain and Barack Obama had to say about the storm. We'll be right back."", ""Bridge City is where we're coming to you from tonight. We saw a long line of military vehicles, National Guard vehicles, heading towards the main part of the city, moving very slowly through these floodwaters. We've been seeing just long lines of paramedics and EMS and first responders just going all day back and forth and bringing people out. We're going to have another hour of coverage. We're going to bring you some of those stories, and also take you to Galveston, where some of the most dramatic stories and some of the worst wreckage that we have seen thus far today. But again, we are still just getting a sense of the scope of the recovery effort that is ahead. The rescue effort still going on right now. I want to show you what the candidates had to say today about what occurred here. At a stop in Manchester, Barack Obama had this to say. Let's play it."", ""During difficult times, during moments of tragedy, the American people come together. We may argue, we may differ, but we are all Americans. And one of the principles of this great country is that during times of need, we are all in it together. And it doesn't matter whether we are Democratic or Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, native-American. We are there for each other at moments of need."", 'And here\'s the comment John McCain released. It\'s a statement. Nothing on videotape. Senator McCain said ""Cindy and I join every American in offering prayers and assistance to those along the Gulf coast. We do know that the economic impact from this storm will be severe. Like most Americans, our main concern about the impact this storm will have on gas prices across the country, but our priority now must be to help the relief effort in any way we can."" That\'s the statement from Senator John McCain referencing also his wife Cindy. Our coverage continues all throughout this next hour from Galveston and Bridge City, where we are right now, and points in between. We\'ll be right back.']","['CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST', 'DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR', 'HONORE', 'LEMON', 'HONORE', 'LEMON', 'ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR', 'GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT', 'COOPER', 'TUCHMAN', 'COOPER', 'ROB MARCIANO, CNN CORRESPONDENT', 'MARK SUDIT', 'MARCIANO', 'SUDIT', 'MARCIANO', 'COOPER', 'CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST', 'COOPER', 'MYERS', 'COOPER', 'COOPER', 'RICK SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR', 'COOPER', 'CHIEF PETTY OFCR.

CNN-134585,THE SITUATION ROOM,2009-1-31,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0901/31/sitroom.01.html,,Replays of Week's Noteworthy Interviews,"[""President Obama's fight for the moral high ground in the war on terror. Will his break with the Bush administration policies put America at risk? I'll ask the new chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein. Plus, Jimmy Carter on his private talks with Mr. Obama about Middle East peace. And something they do not agree on. Stand by for my one-on-one interview with former president Jimmy Carter. And politics and race in the age of Obama. Journalist and author Gwen Ifill shares her insight into the Obama victory and the tightrope Michelle Obama is walking on right now. We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM."", 'We can have legitimate disagreements, but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians. And we will hunt them down. But to the broader Muslim world, what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.', ""President Obama working to heal U.S. relations with the Arab and Muslim world, while standing firm in his commitment to fight terrorists. Mr. Obama is moving quickly to put his own stamp on the war on terror and break with the Bush administration's tactics with the support of key Democratic alleys in Congress."", ""And joining us now from Capitol Hill, the new chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Diane Feinstein, Democrat of California. Senator, first of all, congratulations on getting this important post. I know you've been a member for a long time. After 9/11, there really hasn't been a major terror attack on the U.S. homeland all these years but President Obama is getting ready to change, as they say, the rules of the game in dealing with suspected terrorists. Will America and Americans become more vulnerable?"", ""Well, let me say this. There is a reason there hasn't been another attack and one of the reasons, we've doubled the intelligence budget. Secondly, intelligence is now on the alert. Threats are taken seriously. Things are evaluated carefully and people move quickly. So there is a real active effort to protect American and the apex of that protection is intelligence, good, factual, strong intelligence. And that is what actually protects us."", 'Are you comfortable, though, that suspected terrorists would only be interrogated according to the rules included in the U.S. Army Field Manual, which is very different than what the CIA used to use, as you well know, very enhanced interrogation techniques as they were called?', 'Yes, I am. The Intelligence Committee has asked repeatedly for information as to whether any terrorist efforts had been prevented because of intelligence. Because of coercive interrogation. And we have received no information and we ask again and again and again. So until there is some documentation that coercive interrogation actually will stop a terrorist attack, the answer is no. Let me make another point.', 'Well, let me interrupt you for a second because the vice president, former Vice President Dick Cheney told me recently in an exit interviewed, he believes American lives have been saved because of some of those techniques, including waterboarding on some of the suspected terrorists.', 'Well, then I would say respectfully to the vice president he should send us the specifics of that information. We have asked for it and we have not received it. More importantly ...', 'I think he was referring to Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, the so- called mastermind of 9/11 who by now is widely reported to have been waterboarded.', ""They may well have gotten some information from KSM but the point is, did it stop an actual attack and to the best of my knowledge it did not. Now we ask for that information and on behalf of the committee I asked for that information again. But more importantly, we have had actual testimony where interrogation that does not use coercive mechanisms works better. The FBI did that with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. You had a number of people currently serving time who were convicted based on interrogation that was able to produce evidence to convict them. Secondly, the interrogation of Saddam Hussein was not coercive and the interrogator, again an FBI agent, was able to get enough material to convict him and get a death sentence. So we believe that this can work and as you know President Obama has asked for a special effort to look through the Army Field Manual. The Army Field Manual was recently revised. It can be revised again if it is shown that there are protocols or approaches that might work better. But this business that we have to drop to the lowest common denominator, hire contractors because our government agents don't want to do this kind of work and waterboard certain people or use coercive techniques in a combination and over a length of time where they are debilitated for the rest of their lives, this is not the United States of America and it certainly is not going to be in the administration of Barack Obama."", ""Are you confident, senator, that you're going to get all the information you need from all the intelligence community agencies, including the NSA, the National Security Agency, that will allow you to do the kind of oversight that you're required to do."", ""Well, am I confident was your question? I do know that we want to do everything we can whether it's budget or policy or leadership to see that we have the finest intelligence services in the world. And if we do, and if we are able to use that intelligence wisely and well, unlike the Iraq national intelligence estimate, I believe the answer to your question will be yes. Now there are some ifs and I spelled those out but the intelligence of the United States is very much better today than it was pre-9/11."", ""There is an incident now that's been reported, the former CIA station chief in Algeria is accused of having raped two Algerian women. This comes at a time when the new president is reaching out to the Arab world, the Muslim world, how concerned are you about these allegations. I assume you've been briefed on that."", 'Oh, I am very concerned about them and I have indicated my concern and at 2:30 today the CIA will be briefing the Senate Intelligence Committee on what they know about this. From what I know about it, it is absolutely intolerable and unacceptable and I know the Department of Justice is investigating. They have asked the CIA to say very little but I can sure say something and that is that this man does not belong in the intelligence service of the United States. And if you cannot be a disciplined professional, you do not belong in the intelligence service of the United States. This is not what that service is about.', ""Senator Feinstein, good luck as chair of the Intelligence Committee. You've got your work cut out for you. Appreciate it very much."", 'Thank you, Wolf.', 'From one president to another, inside private talks over at the White House.', 'The night before we had the five presidents luncheon, I spent a long time with President Obama -- president-elect...', 'Just the two of you?', 'Just the two of us.', ""Stand by for my interview with former President Jimmy Carter. Does he have hope for Middle East peace under a new commander in chief? Plus, the unique challenges of being the first African-American First Lady. The journalist Gwen Ifill on Michelle Obama's role. And new revelations about why President Bush didn't land in the hurricane zone right after Katrina. My exclusive interview with the former pilot of Air Force One. Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM."", ""Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is right for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people and that instead it's time to return to the negotiating table. It's going to be difficult. It's going to take time."", 'President Barack Obama giving his first post-inauguration interview to the Arabic language television channel al Arabiya. That was a deliberate move. As president, he brokered the first peace treaty between Israel and Egypt back in 1979. As a former president, he\'s taken some pretty controversial positions on the Middle East conflict. Just before the inauguration, he offered advice on the region to President Barack Obama. We\'re talking about Jimmy Carter. He has a brand new book. It\'s called ""We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land."" We spoke in THE SITUATION ROOM.', 'Has President Obama asked you to do anything, at least at this point? Because the Middle East is obviously for him a huge priority.', ""It is. Not yet, but the night before we had the five presidents' luncheon, I spent a long time with President Obama."", 'Just the two of you.', ""Just the two of us. Well, Rosen (ph) took notes and David Axelrod took notes. Just the four of us in the room. And we talked about the projects of the Carter Center. Health projects and others I need not name to you. And then I would say he was most interested in the Middle East because I had been to that region twice in the previous year and had met with some people that others don't meet with as you probably ..."", 'Like Hamas.', ""Like Hamas. And he wanted to know about those events. And I gave him the first copy of this book. And he asked for it. And I gave it to him. And then I gave him a little summary of things I thought were crucial for the Middle East. And I thanked him for promising during his campaign that he would not wait until the last year he was in office before he started working on the Middle East, but would start immediately. And certainly he's done that."", 'Because that was the criticism you leveled against President Bush, that he waited too long, the last year of his administration, to really push hard on the Israeli-Palestinian ...', 'Bill Clinton did too but he - Bill, I would say that President Clinton did a heroic effort the last year he was in office ...', 'But remember, the first year of his administration, in fairness to Bill Clinton, he did bring Arafat and Rabin together in September 1993 at the White House for that huge signing ceremony.', 'For the signing ceremony.', 'Yeah.', ""But he didn't even know about the negotiation. The negotiation was done by the Norwegians. And the signing ceremony was at the White House."", ""And then he followed up with the Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement in 1994. He's really sensitive, by the way, I've heard from some of his associates, when you criticize him for not doing enough in his first -- early on in his administration. They point out to the Israeli-PLO agreement and to the Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement which has been in force ever since '94."", 'I give Bill full credit for everything he claims.', 'Sorry, well, I just want to - historically...', 'Yeah.', ""But now here you say you spoke with President Obama about Hamas. Here is what President Obama, then candidate Obama told me last May 8th about Hamas and then we'll discuss. Listen to this."", 'They are a terrorist organization that we should not negotiate with them unless they recognize Israel, renounce violence and unless they are willing to abide by previous accords between the Palestinians and the Israelis.', 'All right. Those are the three conditions that not only he, but the Bush administration, the Europeans, others have put forward in order to justify talking with Hamas.', 'Right.', ""You don't except that?"", 'Well, I explained this very well in my book.', 'I read that chapter.', 'Sure, well...', 'You have a separate chapter just on Hamas.', ""Hamas says they acknowledge Israel's right to exist, they accept Israel's right to exist and to live in peace."", ""Because in their public statements they don't say that."", 'They do. They said it publicly. They don\'t use the word ""recognize."" Recognize implies diplomatic recognition. And Hamas said they will not be prepared to recognize Israel\'s right to exist unless Israel is prepared to recognize Hamas and Fatah\'s right to exist.', 'Here\'s what you write in, ""We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land."" You say this. ""Except for some infrequent public statements and assurances given to me based on the prospect of an Israeli-PLO peace agreement, Hamas has not acknowledged Israel\'s right to exist and will not forego violence as a means of ending the occupation of Palestinian territory.""', 'Yes.', ""So they have not acknowledged - you're saying they have not acknowledges Israel's right to exist."", ""They've done it publicly. Yes, they have."", ""But why did you write that they didn't in the book?"", ""I don't remember that particular..."", ""I'll show you right here. This is the -- I highlighted that section over there."", 'Well, but I explained the difference between ""acknowledge"" and ""recognize"" in the book, too. And Hamas also said as I quote in the book, that they will accept any peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians that is negotiated by Hamas if it\'s subsequently submitted to the Palestinians for a referendum. And if a referendum is approved by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, that they will accept it even though they disagree with the terms.', ""Because the argument is, and you've heard it many times, not only from President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others, is that Hamas doesn't, unlike the PLO, Fatah, doesn't accept a two-state solution. They want a one-state solution which is simply Palestine with no Jewish..."", ""No they don't."", '... state in Israel.', ""No way. That's not what they want. No, they don't want a one-state solution. I don't know of any Palestinian that wants a one state solution as a first preference."", 'Are they willing to live, do you believe, Hamas, forget about Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president. Are they willing to live in a new state of Palestine with Israel having an independent state.', ""Yes, they are. They are. And they've made a public statement the same day that I made the statement in Jerusalem, they announced it on al-Jazeera and other news..."", 'Because other spokesmen for Hamas, as you know, disavowed the statement that was made to you.', ""I'm quoting Meshal, who is the top leader and all of his top ..."", ""Khaled Meshal, he's based in Damascus..."", ""That's right."", '...the leader of Hamas.', ""And that's where the politburo is. And all five of its top people were with me."", ""So you're saying that Khaled Meshal, the leader of Hamas, told you flatly that if there were a Palestinian state, right, in the West Bank and Gaza, that they would accept Israel's right to exist and that there would be a recognition of a two-state solution."", 'Well, what he said accurately, to be accurate in quoting...', 'Be precise.', '...he said that he would accept any agreement that was negotiated on a two-state solution between Palestinians and Israelis if it was subsequently submitted to the Palestinians in a referendum in the West Bank and Gaza, or if it was approved by a unity government that had been elected. Either one of those.', ""Iran's president is demanding an apology from the United States for supposed crimes."", ""It's no question that the president of Iran is the most irresponsible blabber mouth in the world."", ""Jimmy Carter was president when Iran held Americans hostage for 445 days. He talks about Iran and about President Obama's efforts to engage the Muslim world. More of my one-on-one interview with Jimmy Carter, coming up.

""Despite the recent lack of progress, I see this as a unique time for hope, not despair.""', ""That's correct."", ""Now, given what's happened in Gaza over the past month, six weeks, whatever, do you still see hope, not despair?"", 'I do. I do. And the basic change is -- the biggest change is the inauguration of a new president.', 'Of the United States?', ""Of the United States. Who has taken a strong role already in pursuing peace in the Middle East.

He reaches out to Iran, says there should be a dialogue. And Ahmadinejad responds, ""You have to apologize,"" he says, for the 60 years of crimes committed against Iran by the United States.', ""There's no question that the president of Iran is the most irresponsible blabbermouth in the world.

Congratulations on the new book.', 'Delighted to be with you, Wolf.', 'Let\'s talk a little about Barack Obama first and foremost, ""The Breakthrough"". Why did he break through when other black politicians before him running for the presidency didn\'t? And you know the names? Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and others.', ""And Carol Moseley Braun and Shirley Chisolm, even. The truth is that Barack Obama is a creature of timing, in much the same way that this book is a creature of timing. People were willing to hear. It didn't hurt that the economy was in a tough space and the message of change helped him a lot more. But it also mattered that you had a candidate who for the first time - a black candidate who for the first time was running in a broader, more coalition-based kind of campaign. Appealing to whites, blacks, Latinos, Asians and telling them that his election would make him less different from them than they thought. That he could solve all their problems. And people heard that and that and connected to that. And more importantly, a whole new generational cohort of people his age and younger really connected with that in a way that none of the previous breakthrough candidates, at least for the presidency, have been able to pull off."", ""I know you interviewed General Colin Powell for the book. Could he have done it had he decided to run in '96 when he was thinking about it?"", ""He was thinking about it, true. But you know what? I did talk to him about it and he didn't think he could have done it. He thought there were still some racial barriers. His wife thought there were some security barriers. And in fact he described it - he didn't have the fire in the belly to run for president in 1996 and if you know anything about presidential candidates, you and I, Wolf, have covered our share, is you've got to really want to do it. You've got to have the audacity in order to break through and if he didn't have it, it wasn't going to be the success he had hoped."", 'Barack Obama certainly has that audacity of hope as all of us know. Let me read to you from the book, ""The Breakthrough."" ""Once he won in Iowa, Obama began regularly collecting 80 and 90 percent of the black vote. Black voters decided Obama could win once white people did, only then did his candidacy catch fire."" Because before Iowa, he was - and Hillary Clinton was basically splitting the African American vote.', ""That's true. And you know, in that he had a lot in common with the other breakthrough candidates I talked to in the book. You look at Duval Patrick, who shared campaign ..."", 'The governor of Massachusetts.', ""... advisers with Obama. The governor of Massachusetts. Only seven percent of Massachusetts was black. So he wasn't relying only on black voters to get him elected. He found a way to appeal to white voters as well. As did Barack Obama. You look at someone like Artur Davis, the congressman from Alabama who wants to run next year for governor of Alabama, which when you think about that is a pretty audacious idea. But he also has to find a way to appeal to voters in Huntsville as well as Birmingham. Statewide. The earlier generation of elected black officials more often relied on coming from congressionally - from small districts which were majority black which had been carved out in a way to enhance their chances of getting elected. This new breakthrough generation, not so much."", 'And including some of the mayors who were elected in predominantly African American cities. Let me read another line because this jumped out at me when I read it in ""The Breakthrough."" ""When given the chance to talk about race in the ways most expected to hear, he,"" referring to Obama, ""resisted. Race was worth talking about, he thought, but only in the context of broader issues. You would never catch this black man with his fist in the air."" All right. I want you to elaborate.', ""Yeah. That's so true. When you think about - think back to Invesco Field when he accepted the nomination in Denver. It was the 45th anniversary of the march on Washington. No one would have held it against him if he had made great connections to how far we had come, how Martin Luther King had stood and spoke on behalf of the dream. In fact, his only reference to King that night was to talk about the Georgia preacher. He didn't bring any attention to that. I was struck the other night with his interview with al Arabiya where he talked about his Muslim - not his upbringing but his background. The fact that his father had been born a Muslim, that he had family members who were Muslim. He didn't talk about that during the campaign, either. And he didn't talk that much about his childhood - not his childhood but his heritage in Kenya. And part of the reason he didn't do it is because as all politicians, he was trying to narrow the differences between him and the people he was asking to for him. So as far as he was concerned, it was obvious that he was African American. He had written about it in his books with far more conscientiousness than most of us ever apply to thinking about our own race. And so he didn't feel the need to talk about it anymore than that because that would only expand the gulf between him and the people he was hoping to vote for him."", 'What about the first lady, Michelle Obama. Is she similar in that respect as part of this breakthrough generation you describe in the book?', ""She is similar in a different way. Michelle Obama like Barack Obama went to law school, Ivy League, very accomplished, had her own career. In that respect she is a lot more like Hillary Clinton than she is like her own husband. Because women breaking through is a little slightly different thing. Especially in such kind of a hidebound and well-defined institution as first lady. So people will be watching very carefully to see what kind of tightrope she manages to walk, mostly because the first lady's job has always been defined as visiting schools and reading to children and picking the china. And one can suspect that Michelle Obama has different ways of putting that together. But that said, she is a breakthrough in that like these other - like these breakthrough candidates in politics, she took advantage of doors that were open for her by an older generation, her parents, people who marched in civil rights marches, what the Obama's call the Moses Generation. And they see themselves as the Joshua Generation, the people whose job it is to take the risks because their parents made the sacrifices."", 'Moses led the Children of Israel out of Egypt but never reached the Promise Land.

Now, a top-secret and very risky trip into the Iraq war zone."", 'There was another flight you took. And that was that first secret trip that President Bush took to Baghdad back on November 26th, 2003.', 'Right.', 'Still a very, very hot zone, as they say, flying into Baghdad, especially without a whole lot of advance notice, was pretty dangerous.', ""It was -- it was dangerous in the fact that we were bringing the president of the United States into the combat zone. At the time, there were quite a few military aircraft that are going in and out of the region. My challenge was to come up with a plan that no one in the world would know that the president had left Washington, D.C., or in this case, had left the ranch and had gone into the combat zone. The challenge wasn't so much to get him in there, because we usually fooled everybody and got him in there. The challenge was once he was on the ground and everybody knew he was there, to get him back out again. So we worked very hard to make sure he had minimum time on the ground. He accomplished his mission, which as he explained to me early on was the goal was to meet with the United States servicemen and women and thank them for everything they'd done and actually serve them Thanksgiving dinner. And he accomplished his mission. It was amazing what he did, taking care of the military."", ""But landing a huge 747 like this one and everybody knows Air Force One in a war zone like that, that must have been an enormous challenge. Because we heard all these stories about - you know, these corkscrew landings. You've got to have a small area and get down really quickly. You didn't do it on that day, did you?"", ""On that day basically, there was a cloud deck over the top of the airport. So as we were flying in there, we knew we could gradually descend, because no one on the ground -- that was the fear, someone on the ground seeing us. So because of the cloud deck, no one could see us. We stayed above the clouds until just prior to the airport. The challenge was, as we were flying into the airport, my man on the ground was calling to the plane saying, you've got to get here fast. The cloud deck is actually moving off the airport. They're going to be able to see you. So we accelerated and came on in. And it was basically one descending turn, completely blacked out in the darkness, to come in and land. And it worked out perfect. The president was behind me in the jump seat, was talking to me the whole time, and looking around the area, very interested in how we were doing it and constantly with us. I mean, it was very nice to have the commander in chief right behind me when I'm going in, taking him into a combat zone."", 'But you say the return, the departure potentially could have been even more dangerous than the surprise landing?', 'Absolutely. The element of surprise was gone. So we basically had -- we gave him about 2.5 hours on the ground, going with the concept that once he was in the airport area, that way the terrorists or such could get information that he was there and they could set up for our departure. So we spent minimum time on the ground. And then we got full of gas. And then we basically climbed out very steep, climbing out. The president was up here in the cockpit with us for the majority of that and then went downstairs. But the problem was that a lot of the folks on the ground, at that point we were afraid, knew that he was -- had actually served the troops and was in the region at the time.', 'How worried were you that day?', ""I was worried in the sense that I had the president of the United States with me. And I had really no military support, because I'd fooled the military as well. So I had to rely totally on the defenses on the aircraft and basically the defenses of the commanders on the ground, who were given very short notice to set up a perimeter to protect the president. The amazing part of the military is you give them notice, they're trained for it. They push the perimeter out immediately, gave me whatever kind of distance I needed to basically climb out steep. And they made it happen on Thanksgiving Day with no knowledge that they were supporting the president of the United States. They were the - you know, we're the military. So you tell us what to do, we make it happen and we protect it."", ""I remember when I was on Air Force One as a reporter covering President Clinton. I was the White House correspondent, flew with him on Air Force One very often.

The president of the United States is on this plane and I felt reassured. Did you always feel like that?"", ""Absolutely. I mean, it was -- one of the president's pilots years ago said the -- he knows he's got the president home safely because he's got a wife and kids back home that he's going home safely to. So the same mentality. I don't think about the president being downstairs. I know I've got, similar to an airline pilot, I got a lot of cherished people in the back.

Let\'s get back to my special series, an exclusive inside look at Air Force One. Shortly before retiring as Air Force One pilot, Colonel Mark Tillman told us about the desperate hours following the 9/11 attacks and a secret flight into Baghdad. Now, one flight that drew criticism.', ""Let's talk about Katrina and that flyover. We saw the picture of the president looking out the window, caused some controversy, as you know. But what was it like on that day, flying over the devastation of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast?"", ""For me, it was special, because I went to Tulane University in New Orleans. So I spent four years in college in New Orleans. So I was very familiar with the area, very familiar with the lake. And so I was very interested when I flew -- we brought the president out of the ranch, brought him into the area. As we were descending into New Orleans, going by the airport, heading into the city, the president was sitting in the jump seat. We started picking up on some of the flooding that was occurring at the time. And we started picking up on some of the flooding that was occurring at the time. Then we went around the Superdome. And totally my fault to get -- I needed to bring him down below the clouds so he could see the area. And that was the president's intent that day was to see exactly what was going on in the area, to go -- basically see the Superdome area, the low-lying areas. And that's what we did. We showed him it. We brought a navigator went downstairs and started pointing out all the different areas in the New Orleans region. And it was - from us in the cockpit, it was amazing. Just for me, growing up there in college, I mean, I had spent a lot of time out at the lake and all the homes were underwater. To me, the amazing thing was the lakefront basically, the carnival area out there, a roller coaster came out of the water. You could see the top of the roller coaster and then went back into the water. So it gave you a sense of just how much water was there and how much devastation. The president saw all that. You know, I'm not a political man, I'm an Air Force officer. So -- but what I saw was the president was actually concerned about the whole area. So you know, a lot of the media had concerns the way we flew around the area, but the goal was to show him the area on the way home."", 'There was never any intent to land right then. The president himself said he was afraid it would have disrupted the recovery operations, law enforcement having, for example, to come and protect him.', 'There was no way I could have landed that day.', 'Even in Baton Rouge?', ""No, because for the president to go to an event site, we can't just take the president into an area and go to an event without all the capability around him. It's -- that day, going into New Orleans, I had to stay well above the helicopters providing relief efforts. So I stayed above them. I stayed out of their way. So I mean, that's the goal in a disaster zone is to stay out of the way of the relief. The president coming in there, it dedicates too many resources to protection of the president. And it takes away from the people. And the staff and the president were very sensitive to that. And they always are. Every time I fly, that is a major concern to get him there. We got him there as quick as we could after that."", ""The Katrina flight, the secret Thanksgiving flight to Baghdad in 2003, and 9/11 were Colonel Tillman's most memorable flights as the pilot of Air Force One."", ""September 11th to me, what a lot of the folks in America didn't get to see was a man making a lot of key decisions based on the information he had at the time, in protecting not only my crew, myself, but the American public. And a lot of folks didn't see that. And it's unfortunate they didn't see that. Same with Katrina. I mean, the president was concerned about coming in to the area. And then shortly after that, when we could get him there, we took him into the New Orleans airport. And that, to me, was -- I sat on the plane here. And we had Mayor Nagin. We had the Governor Blanco. We had all of the folks from the region waiting on the aircraft for us after the president did his tour. And we had a chance to talk with those folks. But the amazing part was, in front of the aerircraft, it was a line of helicopters coming in with many of the injured, many of the folks that they'd saved, which is a tribute to the Coast Guard, the Army. They sprang into action. So I mean, there was not -- there wasn't a concern about who was running the show. The military came into action and the local responders all came into action saving lives, as they do every time.

And one of the best iReports I've seen out of these storms in the last week from Buffalo, and I want to show this to you. And listen to the winds howling in this thing. Oh! Unbelievable. This is from Brandon Sparks. He lives in Buffalo. He said at his house, he had between a foot to a foot-and-a-half of snow, that drifts were over five feet high.

And this was the first storm in a series of two. And today, number two is blowing on through, and you are getting much heavier snow, much poorer visibility. You definitely have to have the chains on if you're trying to travel. I wouldn't really recommend it throughout the Sierras. Take a look at the radar picture here. You can see the snow. You know, we could get up to four feet in the higher elevations here. Into the valleys, we're looking at the rainfall. So tough travel for you in San Francisco, and we're concerned about the burn areas, as well, outside of Los Angeles for some of that flooding. Winter storm warnings and advisories are posted across much of the West, even Portland getting in on some icy conditions, winter storm warnings for you here in Salt Lake City, and that storm will be on the move so it will be one that we're going to be tracking throughout the week. Now, the Southeast, this is really just a rain event, but as you head up into the mountains of north Georgia, on up through the Carolinas, you're going to start to see a little bit of a wintry mix begin to move on in.

CNN-148395,ANDERSON COOPER 360 DEGREES,2010-2-25,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1002/25/acd.01.html,,President Obama Holds Bipartisan Health Care Summit,"[""Good evening. I'm Sanjay Gupta, in for Anderson tonight. You can look at what happened in Washington today as a bunch of politicians simply arguing. Or you might reach into your wallet and pull out one of these, because, at the end of the day, this health insurance card is really what today was all about, getting a card like this to 31 million Americans who don't have one, making it more affordable for the rest who do, keeping the insurance companies accountable, and making sure we all don't go broke in the process. Today, President Obama brought Democrats and Republicans together in another last-ditch attempt at hammering out their differences, all day back and forth. To be honest, all of it just wasn't must-see TV. So, tonight, we're going to do some triage, to borrow a medical term. We watched all of it, so you don't have to. Here's Ed Henry on the moments that counted."", ""The stakes couldn't be higher. He's betting his presidency on getting a health reform deal. This was his last-ditch attempt to save it."", ""What I'm hoping to accomplish today is for everybody to focus not just on where we differ, but focus on where we agree."", 'A tall order, when you throw dozens of members of Congress into a made-for-TV drama at the historic Blair House.', 'Can I just finish, please?', ""The president's 2008 rival, Republican John McCain, quickly tweaked him over campaign promises."", ""Eight times you said that negotiations on health care reform would be conducted with the C-SPAN cameras. I'm glad more than a year later that they are here. Unfortunately, this product was not produced in that fashion. It was produced behind closed doors. It was produced with unsavory -- I say that with respect -- deal-making."", 'The president defended the transparency of the talks and gave as good as he got.', ""Let me just make this point, John, because we're not campaigning anymore. The election's over."", ""Well, I -- I'm reminded of that every day."", 'Well, I -- yes.', 'Even the sharp exchanges were civil, if a bit jaded, each party hammering familiar talking points.', ""The health insurance industry is the shark that swims just below the water. And you don't see that shark until you feel the teeth of that shark."", 'Should', ""After about six hours, Republicans believe they made their case to the American people that the president's plan is simply too costly."", 'It means that, for millions of Americans, premiums will go up, because those -- when -- when people pay those new taxes, premiums will go up, and they will also go up because of the government mandates.', 'But Democrats believe the president got the better of the Republicans.', ""So, Lamar, when you mentioned earlier that you said premiums go up, that's just not the case, according to the Congressional Budget Office."", ""Mr. President, if you're going to contradict me, I ought to have a chance to -- to..."", ""Oh, no, no, no, no. Let me -- and this is an example of where we've got to get our facts straight."", 'A CNN fact check gives the edge to the president. The CBO found that his plan would lower premiums for millions of Americans, and those facing hikes would get better coverage.', 'I will tell you, Ed, sort of listening there, both sides really claiming victory, but we understand you have got more reporting that sort of moves the ball a little further?', ""Well, yes. It shows how the Democrats are more nervous than they're letting on publicly. What I'm picking up from Democrats close to this White House is, they have started warning the president and his top advisers that, if they don't get this health care deal done by late March, when Congress is going away for the Easter recess, they're going to move on when they come back in April, and they want to go back to jobs and the economy, the things the president -- other things the president's been talking about. And what that tells us is, the president has a very narrow window. Basically, from this summit meeting that has ended today, he has one month until the end of March to really move the ball forward. It shows you the clock is ticking. And as much as they were publicly trying to project some confidence, behind the scenes, what I'm picking up is that Democrats are very nervous about trying to get this through quickly in the next month. It's a tall order for sure, Sanjay."", 'Yes. You definitely felt that sense of urgency today, for sure. Ed Henry, thanks so much. Let\'s dig a little deeper now with senior political analyst David Gergen, who was on the Clinton White House staff the last time health care reform was tried, Dr. Bernadine Healy as well, former head of the National Institutes of Health and currently health editor for ""U.S. News & World Report,"" also with us, Dr. Sandeep Jauhar, cardiologist and author of ""Intern: A Doctor\'s Initiation."" Thanks to all of you for joining us. A fascinating day. David, you know, it was interesting. Right off the top, it seemed like the president took away this idea that people have been bandying around for some time that maybe the whole thing should just start all over again. I know you spoke to David Axelrod about that as well earlier today. David, where does this go from here? How important was this day?', 'Well, I think it was an extremely good day for American politics, because the people of the country had a chance to listen to what I thought was a robust exchange over the course of the day. And we will come back to the politics. But I think the -- Sanjay, where this winds up is that any idea of a grand bargain or compromise between the Republicans and Democrats is now gone. The Republicans want the president and the Democrats to start over. They\'re not going to do that. The Democrats are asking the Republicans, well, give us some of your amendments. Maybe we will tack them on to our bill. The Republicans are not going to do that. So, that\'s gone. And what is now left is whether the president and the Democrats are going to use this so-called process of reconciliation to try to pass a comprehensive bill. And, at this point, they may -- they do not appear to have the votes to do that, but they will try to do that over the coming month. If they -- if they feel they can\'t do that, that they don\'t have the votes, then they may revert to plan B, a watered-down version, which, as ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported today, and CNN has been confirming, would involve extending health insurance to about 15 million Americans, instead of 30 million Americans. But even that could be a heavy lift.', ""That's sort of a field goal, instead of a touchdown, if they are on the 99-yard line, as they have been talking about. David, later on, I'm going to ask you if this should pass and can it pass. But let me go to Dr. Healy for a second. Dr. Healy, you heard -- you heard Ed Henry's report just a little bit ago. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the president's plan would lower premiums for millions of Americans, and those facing hikes would actually get better coverage. I mean, what -- you -- you have written about this extensively. What is wrong with that?"", ""Well, I think what's wrong with it is that you have to define what better coverage is. Sure, you get a more comprehensive, more detailed plan, but maybe you're a 30-year-old person who could -- who could get coverage for $1,000 with a catastrophic plan and with primary care, inexpensive primary care visits, and you don't want the $5,000 plan, you don't want to pay that extra few thousand dollars to have that bigger plan, and, as a matter of fact, you can't afford it, and you don't want to have to go on the government dole. Just give me my $1,000 plan. So, that is the fundamental problem. The -- the fact is that premiums will go up, and they will go up on people who don't necessarily need that expensive policy. And what -- what this is showing is that the -- the individual, the patient, has been left out of this whole discussion. And I listened to the whole thing. Where is the patient?"", 'Right.', 'We have heard lots of politicians. We hear lawyers. We hear everything else.', 'Yes.', 'Where is the patient consideration?', ""Well, we're definitely going to talk about that a lot. But let me -- before I get to Dr Jauhar -- should everybody has insurance, Dr. Healy? Should -- should everyone -- is everyone supposed to have it, or should they have insurance? Should it be mandated?"", ""I think everybody should have insurance that suits them individually, at their stage in life and at -- considering their personal needs. And I think, for young people, a catastrophic policy, in which they save money for the future, they have a health savings account, that makes a lot of sense. When you're older, something different is better, and a more expensive policy is more important."", 'All right.', ""And the fact that the president almost scorned it, he called the catastrophic policy Acme insurance, says that he has a very rigid notion that there is one-size-fits-all policy for every American. And I think that's wrong. And it made me think, boy, we have to start over."", ""Well, I know Dr. Jauhar has some -- something to say about this. A lot of the president's critics, Sandeep, say spending nearly a trillion dollars on health care reform is simply not the right way to save money, that, on a fundamental level, it would just make the federal government more bloated. Do you share that concern? I mean, should the federal -- what's the federal government's role here? And what about what Dr. Healy said?"", ""Well, I mean, if -- if you listen to the -- the estimates from the White House, the -- their plan will cut the budget deficit by about $100 billion over 10 years. So, you know, we're talking about a system that occupies one- sixth of our economy. It is, by all accounts, tremendously wasteful. And it's not working for more than 50 million Americans. So, something has to be done to correct the inequities and the waste. And the fact is, you know, I keep hearing that the system -- that the plan is so revolutionary. But the fact is that it builds on what we already have. And if you compare the -- the -- the reform measures that are being proposed and -- with what was done in Western Europe post-World War II, I mean, these are very -- these are fairly incremental measures that -- that we're talking about."", ""All right, we -- we're going to drill down on some of the specific details. And, to Dr. Healy's point, we're going to talk about what this means to you folks. We're going to get back to all of you in just a moment. Let us know what you think. The live chat is up and running -- AC360.com. You can also send your questions and comments to me on Twitter at SanjayGuptaCNN. Up next: David Gergen just mentioned it, the way President Obama might try to push a reform bill through Congress. It's called reconciliation. Do you know what it really means and why everyone is really yelling about it? Stick around. Later, what's with that big stack of paper, the body language, all the catchphrases that were used today? You know what? We're going to translate this into plain English, all the stagecraft, tonight -- all of it on 360.""]","['SANJAY GUPTA, CNN ANCHOR', 'ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over)', 'BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES', 'HENRY', 'SEN.

Expecting to hear from the president, some comments from him at the White House. Expecting him to take a couple of questions at a live press event. We will take you there live when that does happen. You see down at the bottom, we are keeping an eye on it. We will take you there live. Now, you can expect, probably, a question or two. Maybe the first one that comes at him is going to be about General Stanley McChrystal, the general who, yesterday, he accepted the resignation of, who was his top general in administration. Well, that general is out now. General Petraeus, David Petraeus, is in, has agreed to take over as the top guy in Afghanistan. We were hearing from him today. We're also hearing from the other top military man, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mullen, and also Defense Secretary Gates. They were all speaking today Let's start though with General Petraeus. He spoke to our Dana Bash, who was able to catch up with him today on Capitol Hill. Take a listen."", ""Well, it's a privilege to serve. It's obviously a hugely important mission. It's very sad that I have to assume it in this manner. We obviously all have enormous respect and gratitude to General McChrystal for all that he did. He's played a key role in helping get the inputs right in Afghanistan, as I described on Capitol Hill the second day I testified."", 'Do you see yourself doing anything to change the 2011 deadline to begin troop withdrawal?', ""No. As I said, I support the president's policy and I will also provide the best professional military advice as we conduct assessments."", 'All right. Again, a little choppy there, a little tough to hear some of that audio, but you could read it there as well. Petraeus talking about his mission now moving ahead as the top guy in Afghanistan. Our Dana Bash catching up with him in the hall. We also were able to hear from Secretary Gates today. Secretary Gates talking at the Pentagon today. You heard it here live on our air last hour, but talking about in a lot of ways how personal this was for him and how close he is to General McChrystal, hated to see him have to fall like this, but also saying, no doubt, he made just a bad error in judgment. But Secretary Gates also looking ahead, trying to reassure the American public that this war and the policy will continue. Take a listen to him.', ""My primary concern over the past few days has been to minimize the impact of these developments on the conduct of the war in Afghanistan. The president's decisions fully and satisfactorily address that concern. This is the best possible outcome to an awful situation."", ""Again, Secretary Gates speaking a little earlier today. And we can probably expect when the president steps out -- think he's going to take a couple of questions. So when he does, good chance he might get one or two about General McChrystal and how everything went down yesterday in his one-on-one meeting, then accepting the resignation. But, again, bottom of your screen, we're keeping an eye. That is a live picture out of the White House. We will take you there live when the president does step out to speak. Keeping an eye on it. I'm told we do have a two-minute warning before the president steps out. Let me go to our Jill Dougherty, who is in the room. She is just there with us. You won't be able to see her, but she is in there. Jill, I believe you can hear me now."", 'Yes.', ""And tell us -- we know the president's here to speak with the Russian -- or have an announcement with the Russian president. But people in the room there, are they anticipating that the president might get a question about Stanley McChrystal?"", 'Oh, there\'s no question. I mean, that is the subject that\'s really overshadowing a lot of this. And all of the president\'s people are saying the mission will continue, nothing changes. Personalities change, but the mission does not. But that really is a question. I mean, are there issues, are there frustrations, are there concerns about things like the July 2011 deadline? Some media operations like ""The New York Times"" even said let\'s clean house, let\'s start new, with a new team. Replace, for example, Richard Holbrooke, who\'s the special representative on Afghanistan and Pakistan, and replace the ambassador, Eikenberry. Many different things. Start over. Perhaps we\'ll hear some of that answer from the president. But there are serious concerns. And then, of course, we have the serious issues that he wants to discuss with the Russian president.', ""And we see several other members starting -- other people starting to walk into the room. But, again, like you said there, Jill, this event is supposed to be an event between the president of the U.S. and the president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is in the U.S. He spent some time out in Silicon Valley, out in California, because he is here to tout and pretty much sell his country for investment, trying to build up some partnerships, get people to invest money over in Russia. That's what this event is supposed to be about. But it certainly sounds like to you, from hearing from you, it's being overshadowed a bit and everybody in the room is buzzing about what happened yesterday."", 'Yes. Well, we were actually on that trip out west to California, to Silicon Valley, with President Medvedev. In fact, CNN was the only network that was allowed to do that. And it was a fascinating trip. I just got back, in fact, early this morning. Here we go.', 'Ladies and Gentlemen, the president of the United States and the president of the Russian Federation.', "", PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES Good afternoon, everybody. Please be seated. Dobry den. After many meetings around the world, I am delighted to welcome my friend and partner, President Medvedev, to the White House. This is also an opportunity to return the wonderful hospitality that the president, Mrs. Medvedeva, and the Russian people showed me and my family during our visit to Moscow one year ago. Michelle and I enjoyed a wonderful evening at the president's home. Our daughters will never forget having tea in the winter garden of the Kremlin. And, Mr. President, I hope you'll remember having a burger at Ray's Hell Burger today. We just concluded some excellent discussions, discussions that would have been unlikely just 17 months ago. As we've both said before, when I came into office, the relationship between the United States and Russia had drifted, perhaps to its lowest point since the Cold War. There was too much mistrust and too little real work on issues of common concern. That did not serve the interests of either country or the world. Indeed, I firmly believe that America's most significant national security interests and priorities could be advanced most effectively through cooperation, not an adversarial relationship with Russia. That's why I committed to resetting the relationship between our two nations. And in President Medvedev, I've found a solid and reliable partner. We listen to one another, and we speak candidly. So, Mr. President, I am very grateful for your leadership and your partnership. By any measure, we have made significant progress and achieved concrete results. Together, we negotiated and signed the historic New START Treaty, committing our nations to significant reductions in deployed nuclear weapons. Today, we reaffirmed our commitment to work to ratify this treaty as soon as possible so it can enter into force and set the stage for further cuts and cooperation. Together, we've strengthened the global nonproliferation regime, so that as we meet our obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, other nations meet theirs and are held accountable if they don't. Along with our international partners, we passed and are enforcing new U.N. sanctions against North Korea. We offered Iran the prospect of a better future, and when they refused, we joined with Russia and our partners on the Security Council to impose the toughest sanctions ever faced by the government of Iran. Together, our nations have deepened our cooperation against violent extremism, as terrorists threaten both our people, be it in Times Square or in Moscow. And today, we've agreed to expand our cooperation on intelligence and counter terrorism. Russian transit routes now play a vital role in supplying American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. And to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons, we came together at our nuclear security summit, where our two nations made numerous commitments, including agreeing to eliminate enough plutonium for about 17,000nuclear weapons. Together, we've coordinated our efforts to strengthen the global economic recovery through the G-20, work that we will continue in Toronto this weekend. And today we agreed to continue closely to coordinate our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts following the tragic outbreak of ethnic violence in Kyrgyzstan. Our two countries continue to disagree on certain issues, such as Georgia, and we addressed those differences candidly. But by moving forward in areas where we do agree, we have succeeded in resetting our relationship, which benefits regional and global security. This includes, I would note, a change in the attitudes among the Russian people, who today have a far more favorable view of the United States, and that in turn creates more space for additional partnership. Indeed, this has been the real focus of our work today and of President Medvedev's visit, not simply resetting our relationship, but also broadening it, because 20 years after the end of the Cold War, the U.S.-Russian relationship has to be about more than just security and arms control. It has to be about our shared prosperity and what we can build together. That's why we created the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission during my visit to Moscow last year to forge new partnerships, not just between governments, but between our businesses, our peoples, and our societies. And today, we agreed to forge new cooperation across a whole range of areas. In particular, we're expanding trade and commerce. We agreed to deepen our collaboration on energy efficiency and clean-energy technologies. And this afternoon, President Medvedev and I will join American and Russian business leaders as they move forward with a series of major trade and investment deals that will create jobs for Americans and Russians across many sectors, from aerospace and automotive engineering to the financial sector and high technology. Consistent with my administration's national export initiative, this includes the sale of 50 Boeing aircraft worth $4 billion that could add up to 44,000 new jobs in the American aerospace industry. To deepen Russia's integration into the global economy, I reaffirmed our strong commitment to Russia's ascension to the World Trade Organization. Today, we've reached an agreement that will allow the United States to begin exporting our poultry products to Russia once again. And I want to thank President Medvedev and his team for resolving this issue, which is of such importance to American business and which sends an important signal about Russia's seriousness about achieving membership in the WTO. Therefore, I told President Medvedev that our teams should accelerate their efforts to work together to complete this process in the very near future. Russia belongs in the WTO. That's good for Russia, it's good for America, and it's good for the world economy. I appreciated very much the opportunity to hear President Medvedev's vision for modernization in Russia, especially high-tech innovation as a personal passion of the president. And during his visit to Silicon Valley this week, he visited the headquarter of Twitters (sic), where he opened his own account. I have one, as well, so we may be able to finally throw away those red phones that have been sitting around for so long."", 'They represented the hope for the future that brings our countries together. Those were the same hopes of another generation of Americans and Russians, the generation that stood together as allies in the Second World War, the great patriotic war in which the Russian people suffered and sacrificed so much. We recently marked the 65th anniversary of our shared victory in that war, including that historic moment when American and Soviet troops came together in friendship at the Elbe River in Germany. A reporter who was there at that time, all those years ago, said, ""If there is a fine, splendid world in the future, it will largely be because the United States and Russia get on well together. If it is in trouble, it will be because they don\'t get on well. It\'s as simple as that."" Mr. President, the decades that followed saw many troubles, too many troubles. But 65 years later, it\'s still as simple as that. Our countries are more secure and the world is safer when the United States and Russia get on well together. So I thank you for your partnership and your commitment to the future that we can build together for this and for future generations. With that, let me introduce President Medvedev.', ""Thank you, Mr. President. (through translator): Distinguished colleagues, of course I must start with thanking my counterpart, President Barack Obama, for your invitation to visit the United States of America with a visit and for the exceptional hospitality and generosity we have observed here. The weather is so warm that it leaves no doubt that everything is the result of hard work for -- in terms of preparation of the visit. Our delegation appreciated the hospitality. And in Moscow, we met various places. And today, I have managed to dine with President Barack Obama, an interesting place, which is typically American. Probably it's not quite healthy, but it's very tasty, and you feel -- you can feel the spirit of America. But this is not the main thing we were engaged in. Our delegation, the Russian delegation, had a very busy schedule, and -- which started in California, which is an unparalleled event besides the fact that it is a very beautiful place on the coast of the United States. It's a token (ph) place, and I hope this is a symbolic launch of cooperation between our countries in the sphere of innovation and high-tech. We spoke about -- we have spoken about it today with President and before, saying that we have done a lot to build confidence between our countries. We have made steps aimed at establishing a more firm construction of our relations, structure of our relations, and to a certain extent, we made our world safer, I must say this. But this is not enough for bilateral economic ties to change. And this visit is generally mostly aimed at achieving these goals. We are ready for that now; our American partners are ready for the same thing. President and I agreed to work in this sphere, and today the main part of our talks was with regards to economic issues and, first of all, the very complicated issues such as membership in WTO. Mr. President has just said that we have reached progress and made headway, but we will later discuss it probably. I am sure that such cooperation as cooperation in high-tech sphere can be mutually beneficial, including in this framework of those new projects created in -- in Russia. We are establishing our continuation, so to say, of the Silicon Valley not far from Moscow, which is the Skolkovo Center, and we hope that our American partners will actively partake in this project, and we'll have some good groundwork for that in my yesterday's talk in the Silicon Valley and the forum that was held in St. Petersburg, the economic forum. The decisions of major companies to come to Russia with such investment, all this inspires us and shows that we can agree not only on missiles or at some important and complicated issues of an international agenda. I count on the fact that in Russia we'll soon have this relevant business in place. Yesterday, we had an interesting event in my life. I visited the Stanford University, which is a well-known university with special climate, and I was enjoying walking and strolling around Stanford without necktie or any suit, in jeans, which was a pleasure for those people who occupy high posts. I also spoke with students, professors, and tutors, and the faculty was an open, frank, and candid communication. And I felt their interest in strengthening our good relations and address creating new high-tech projects in the Russian Federation and the United States. As far as the talks of today are concerned, Mr. President has said in detail about everything. I have practically nothing to add. We went through all the issues and the items of agenda. We're interested in removing the obstacles accumulated over the previous period in -- in this area of bilateral trade and investment. Russia has been actively participating in national labor division. And after the Washington summit is over, we will fly, well, by different planes -- we'll fly to Canada, where we will address the issue of promoting our common -- common view and common goals and discussing the global financial agenda. And on our mutual understanding, a lot depends on the format ofG- 20 including. Today we have spoken about our economies' responses to the effects of the crisis. So we believe that much is done, but --but a lot has been -- has to be done. President told me about many innovations and novelties he's trying to push through the Congress to make U.S. economy more stable. I briefed him on our crisis exit measures. I believe it was a helpful exchange of opinions, and I hope that in a cooperative way we will together discuss the issues of restoring the global finance and establishing the new financial order during the G-20 meeting. There are some things that should be substantially changed. I mean, the investment climate, we should provide a stimulus to our businessmen to be more attentive and thoughtful towards each other to invest funds in each other's economies, and this is why, after the press conference, we're going to meet our business communities of our countries, and we will talk our future steps so that the level of economic investment cooperation is in line with the potential of the U.S. and the Russian economies. Over the last period of time, we established -- we created a number of useful tools. One of them is a presidential commission that has been mentioned by Mr. Obama. On the one hand, it's a common instrument, but on the other hand, it's a mechanism that provides of effective interaction, which is in line with the current spirit and level of our friendly (ph) partnership relations that -- and also my relations between Mr. Obama and me. So I hope all the colleagues that are present here and that are members of the commission will actively work to implement the plans that we have. So we went through the national agenda. And today, we devoted less time to it, because in our previous meetings, when we devoted a lot, it -- still have managed to do something. We spoke the Middle East crisis and the resolution on Iran, the Korean Peninsula developments, the Kyrgyzstan developments, and some other most complicated issues that are currently on our planet. We also spoke about European security. We believe that - we share a common view that Europe should have this security system. We have some differences. And Mr. President mentioned it, in terms of, for example, the aftereffects of the conflict that was initiated by Georgia's leadership (ph) in 2008, but these differences did not prevent us from discussing future and launching new mechanisms of contact. We discussed the situation around the new START treaty. Our goal, the goal of the two presidents, is to ensure tranquilratification of the treaty by our parliament. I hope it's going to be done in the near future. For example, in the statement of the Federation Council, thee are hearings in place. There are hearings on -- and in - in Congress, there are hearings, as far as I know, as well as in Senate. So these active discussions should reveal the truth and synchronize the process of ratification. We keep thinking about our next future steps, and this is a serious responsibility of the Russian Federation and the United States, would not lift this responsibility or shirk it. We will keep in touch, and I'm also always ready to discuss various issues with my colleague and my counterpart, and we succeed in -- in these discussions. Last time, President and I spoke over the phone, it was a record, my record of phone conversation. Probably Obama has some longer records. It lasted 1 hour 45 minutes, which is a lot, I may say frankly, and the ear starts getting stiff. But the result -- I will not brief you on the -- on the nuances, on the topics we discussed. We were both interested and submerged into the topic, not only our aides, our ministers should be that responsible, but we, too. So I'm thankful to my counterpart for -- for his -- his active cooperation and for a warm welcome here in Washington. Thank you so much."", ""OK. We're going to -- we're going to take some questions. We will start with Carol Lee of Politico."", ""Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Does the change in command in Afghanistan change your timetable for withdrawal? Is there likely to be any disruption, particularly given Secretary Gates seemed to contradict Vice President Biden's comments that you can bet on a large number of troops withdrawing in July of 2011? So are you confident that everyone on your team is on the same page when it comes to your plan? Do you expect anyone else to leave? And if I may, too, President Medvedev, given your country's history and experience in Afghanistan, and your ability to talk candidly with President Obama, have you offered him any advice on the Afghan war? And do you believe that a foreign country can win in Afghanistan? Thank you."", ""The short answer is that what we saw yesterday was a change in personnel, but not a change in policy. Let me flesh that out. When we engaged in an extensive review last year, General Petraeus was part of a group that included Secretaries Gates, Clinton, my national security team, that discussed extensively what our various options were in Afghanistan. And what was determined was, number one, that we had to be very clear on our mission. Our mission, first and foremost, is to dismantle and destroy Al Qaeda and its affiliates so that they can't attack the United States. The reason we're there in the first place is because 3,000 Americans were killed from an attack launched in that region. We are not going to have that repeated. In order to achieve that, we have to make sure that we have a stable Afghan government, and we also have to make sure that we've got a Pakistani government that is working effectively with us to dismantle these networks. What we then said was we would put in additional troops to provide the time and the space for the Afghan government to build up its security capacities, to clear and hold population centers that are critical, to drive back the Taliban, to break their momentum, and that beginning next year, we would begin a transition phase in which the Afghan government is taking more and more responsibility for its own security. Here's what we did not say last year. We did not say that, starting July 2011, suddenly there would be no troops from the United States or allied countries in Afghanistan. We didn't say we'd be switching off the lights and closing the door behind us. We said that we'd begin a transition phase in which the Afghan government is taking on more and more responsibility. That is the tragedy that was put forward. What we've also said is, is that, in December of this year, a year after this strategy has been put in place, at a time when the additional troops have been in place and have begun implementing strategy, that we'll conduct a review and we'll make an assessment. Is the strategy working? Is it working in part, or are there other aspects of it that aren't working? How's the coordination between civilian and military? Are we doing enough to build Afghan security capacity? How are we working effectively with our allies?"", ""So we are in the midpoint of implementing the strategy that we came up with last year. We'll do a review at the end of this year. General Petraeus understands that strategy because he helped shape it. And my expectation is that he will be outstanding in implementing it, and we will not miss a beat because of the change in command in the Afghan theater. Keep in mind that, during this entire time, General Petraeus has been the CENTCOM commander, which means he's had responsibility in part for overseeing what happened in Afghanistan, and -- and that is part of the reason why I think he's going to do such a capable job. Not only does he have extraordinary experience in Iraq, not only did he help write the manual for dealing with insurgencies, but he also is intimately familiar with the players. He knows President Karzai. He knows the other personnel who are already on the ground. So our team is going to be moving forward in sync. It is true that I am going to be insisting on a unity of purpose on the part of all branches of the U.S. government that reflects the enormous sacrifices that are being made by the young men and women who are there. I mean, every time I go to Walter Reed, when I visit Afghanistan and I visit the hospitals, and you see young men and women who are giving their all, making enormous sacrifices on behalf of the security of this nation, my expectation is, is that the leadership is true to those sacrifices, that the strategy that we're promoting, the manner in which we are working together at the leadership level fully respect-- fully reflects and honors the incredible dedication of our young men and women on the ground. That's what I expect, and I believe that is what I will receive. Was there one last aspect to the question?"", 'Does anyone else need to -- to go in the chain of command?', ""I am confident that we've got a team in place that can execute. And -- now, I'm paying very close attention to make sure that they execute. And I will be insisting on extraordinary performance moving forward. One last thing I just want to remind everybody, though, that the issues with General McChrystal that culminated in my decision yesterday were not as a -- as a result of a difference in policy. I want to be very clear about that. He was executing the policy that I had laid out, that he was executing the orders that I had issued, and that were reflective of the review process that took place last year."", ""I'll try to be even briefer than my colleague, Mr. President. You know, I hope that I have quite friendly relations with President Obama, but I try not to give pieces of advice that cannot be fulfilled. This is a hard topic, a difficult one. I can say only two things. First of all, we believe that, at present, the United States and s me other countries are assisting the Afghan people in obtaining the much-wanted statehood and restore the basis of the functioning of an effective state, restore the civil society and the economy. And in these terms, we will support and back the efforts of the U.S. As far as our own experience, well-known experience as concerned, I'd very much like to see the Afghan people in near future having an effective state and a modern economy, and -- which requires toiling and more than a year, but this is the path to guarantee that the --the most -- the gravest scenarios of the -- of the last time will not repeat. Please, Itar Tuss (ph)?"", ""Good day (inaudible) my question to president of the United States, who just mentioned that you discussed the issue of Russia joining the WTO during your talks. But I must admit that and state that the promises to facilitate Russia's entry has been heard by Russian delegation for decade. Could you more specifically name the timeframe when you are referring to finalizing the process in near future? And a question to Medvedev. Yesterday, you visited the Silicon Valley. How did your perceptions on future cooperation between Russia and the U.S. in high-tech sphere change? And what indicators should be reached so that you can call the cooperation a successful one? Thank you."", ""On the WTO, first of all, I emphasized to President Medvedev, I emphasized to his entire delegation, and I now want to emphasize to the Russian people: We think it is not only in the interests of the Russian Federation, but in the interest of the United States and in the interest of the world that Russia joins the WTO. So this is something that we want to get resolved. In terms of timeframe, let me give you a sense of perspective from our U.S. trade representative, Ron Kirk, who has been in close contact and negotiations with his counterparts on the Russian side. The way he described it is that 90 percent, 95 percent of the issues have now been resolved. Now, the remaining 5 percent to 10 percent are difficult issues and are going to require some significant work. But that should give you some sense that a lot of work has already been done, even in the last few months, that makes an enormous difference. Now, in our joint statement, what we are going to essentially instruct our negotiators is that they try to come to terms with the technical issues that remain by the fall. We are going to keep putting pressure on negotiators in the same way that we did during the START treaty, so that these -- there's a sense of urgency on the part of our team. A lot of the technical issues, the resolution of those technical issues, though, may be in the hands of the Russian government. We've already made progress on some issues like encryption, for example. There may be certain international standards that require modifications in Russian law. So as much as possible, what I've told my team is, we are going to do everything we can to get this done as quickly as possible, and we will be very specific and very clear about the technical issues that Russia still faces, and Russia then will act in accordance with its needs and requirements internally to meet the demands of the WTO in order to get this done. But I'm confident that we can get this completed. And I am confident that President Medvedev and his vision for an innovative, modernized, energized economy are entirely consistent with Russia's joining the WTO. And I also just want to just say this. You know, sometimes it's odd when you're sitting in historic meetings with your Russian counterpart to spend time talking about chicken, but our ability to get resolved a trade dispute around poultry that is a multibillion- dollar export for the United States was, I think, an indication of the seriousness with which President Medvedev and his team take all of these trade and commercial issues. And I very much appreciate the steady and consistent manner in which the president has approached these issues. That's part of what gives me confidence that we're going to get this done and that this will just be one aspect of a broader strengthening of commercial ties, cross-border investment, and expanded opportunities and job creation, both in the Russian Federation and in the United States."", ""I will say a couple of words about the WTO, because it's important for our country. First of all, we coordinated -- we have coordinated a common approach today, which says that substantive issues almost off, almost no left. So moved along all the lines, starting from encryption and intellectual property and ending with state bodies (ph) and other things like synchronous character of changing of the Russian legislation, as in the process of joining the WTO. There are some remaining technical, minor problems, and our teams have been instructed to work as fast as possible, and we hope and we have stated this, that the work will be finalized by the end of September this year. I'm quite happy that we have set the timeframe not to lose all the positive momentum about (inaudible) and not to dilute the talks about WTO in the -- in the issues of chicken meat or swine trimming, why (ph) a different situation today. As far as cooperation in the Silicon Valley is concerned, while yesterday paid heed that everyone wishes to call the Silicon Valley the Kremlin Valley (ph) in Russia, probably for English, there is no difference, but in Russia, there is. So in the Kremlin Valley (ph), it was very interesting, the visit timing (ph), and I looked at the activities of major companies that will, as I hope, become our close partners for modernization and technological advancement of our economies, like -- those like Cisco. And yesterday we inked a memorandum on investment and some projects to the tune of great sums, and also I watched the activities of small companies situated in the Silicon Valley which set an example of being efficient and effective in risk (ph) of high-tech business. It's very good that our companies settle in the Silicon Valley. Yesterday, I browsed through search engine Yandex, which is our number-one search engine, and while their major systems for such information in the world, so we should -- we should learn how to work and we should not swagger, saying that we are clever enough. We have something to learn in terms of organizing business, and this is prompted by my talk with the representatives of Russian business communities that move to the United States or are here on a temporary basis. All of them are wishing to work with Russian investors. Many of them want to come back to Russia. But they do have precious experience as the Silicon Valley and what is done there. And it's first and foremost people, their minds and their ability and skills, and only after money and an infrastructure. So we will carefully study the experience of the Silicon Valley. And without replicating, we will use the best practices and samples that exist in California in the framework of that major product that is called the Silicon Valley."", 'Elster Boll (ph)?', ""Thank you very much, Mr. President. I'd like to ask about the G-20, since you're both heading to the summit. On China, you've already welcomed its decision on the yuan. Are you satisfied with how far the currency has moved since that news? How will this influence your judgment on whether China is a currency manipulator? And when will you release your report to Congress on this matter?"", ""OK. The -- I think that China made progress by making its announcement that it's going to be returning to its phased-in ,market-based approach to the RMB. The initial signs were positive, but it's too early to tell whether the appreciation that will track the market is sufficient to allow for the re balancing that we think is appropriate. I'm going to leave it up to Secretary Tim Geithner to make a determination as to the pace. He's the expert when it comes to examining the currency markets. I will say that we did not expect a complete 20 percent appreciation overnight, for example, simply because that would be extremely disruptive to world currency markets and to the Chinese economy. And ultimately, not surprisingly, China's got to make these decisions based on its sovereignty and its - its economic platform. But we have said consistently that we believe that the RMB is undervalued, that that provides China with an unfair trade advantage, and that we expect change. The fact that they have said they are beginning that process is positive, and so we will continue to monitor and verify how rapidly these changes are taking place. And I think that we will be able to track a trajectory. And if that trajectory indicates that, over the course of the year, the RMB is appreciated a certain amount, that it is more in line with economic fundamentals, then I -- hopefully not only will that be good for the U.S. economy, that will also be good for the Chinese economy and the world economy. More broadly, just to -- to widen out the challenges that the world economy faces, we said in Pittsburgh in the G-20 that it was important for us to rebalance. In part because the U.S. economy for along period of time was the engine of world economic growth, we were sucking in imports from all across the world financed by huge amounts of consumer debt. Because of the financial crisis, but also because that debt was fundamentally unsustainable, the United States is not going to be able to serve in that same capacity to that same extent. We are obviously still a huge part of the world economy. We are still going to be open. We are still going to be importing, as well as exporting. But the economic realities are such that for us to see sustained global economic growth, all countries are going to have to be moving in some new directions. That was acknowledged in Pittsburgh. That means that surplus countries are going to have to think about, how are we spurring domestic demand? That means that emerging countries are going to have to think, are we only oriented towards exports, or are we also starting to produce manufacturing goods and services for the internal market? It means that deficit countries have to start getting serious about their mid-term and long-term debt and deficits, and that includes the United States of America, which is why I've got a fiscal commission that's going to be reporting to me by the end of the year. So the point is, not every country is going to respond exactly the same way, but all of us are going to have responsibilities to rebalance in ways that allow for long-term, sustained economic grow thin which all countries are participating and hopefully the citizens of all these countries are benefiting. All right?"", ""(inaudible) newspaper. We have a question for both presidents. You said that you discussed the situation in Kyrgyzstan. Do you share your -- the view on the problem? And what are joint ways of solving it? It's known that Russian (inaudible) have military bases in the republic, so do you consider (inaudible) involve a military contingent (inaudible) in --in Kyrgyzstan keeps deteriorating?"", ""Yes, we have discussed this issue as the situation in the republic is difficult at present. The state is not operating as it should, while the country de facto is split into parts and civil unrest and clashes continue on ethnic grounds. Very many people have perished, and the authorities have been incapable of preventing what has happened. So we are interested, both Russia and the States, in the - in the state's ability in Kyrgyzstan to be able to resolve such issues, to -- and look at all the civil rights are observed, and the tasks of ensuring food supplies and basic material -- material facilities are ensured. Russia is working with the temporary caretaker leadership of Kyrgyzstan. We believe that they should prove their legitimate character nature, but we consider Kyrgyzstan to be a strategic partner. We will help them, both in terms of money and humanitarian aid. We hope that, during the election process, a full-fledged government will be shaped, able to solve and rest the issues that face the -- this state. Otherwise, Kyrgyzstan will degrade and will - and will break up into parts. All of us share a concern that, under these circumstances, radical elements may rise to power in that country. And in this case, we will have to address the issues that are addressed by us and other regions. I am -- I am referring to the goals that we have in Afghanistan. We discussed this issue. And if we are talking about an - a possibility of some enforcing order, well, I believe that Kyrgyzstan should on its own cope with these problems. Russian -- the Russian Federation does not plan any deployment of a military -- of a peaceful contingent (ph). And I got a letter from the acting president of Kyrgyzstan, Roza Otunbayeva, but there is the consultations mechanism in the CSTO format. Head of Security Council met to discuss the -- the issue of security and of deploying a peacekeepers contingent. So far, there is no need, they have decided, but these things may start developing by different scenarios, so CSTO will respond. And me being a chair, the chairman of the organization, any time can convene a meeting of relevant bodies, and we hope that the United States do -- does have an understanding."", ""The only thing I would add is, obviously, we're monitoring the situation very carefully. There already has been excellent coordination between the United States and the Russian Federation on delivery of humanitarian aid. One of the things that we discussed is creating a mechanism so that the international community can ensure that we have a peaceful resolution of the situation there and that any actions that are takent to protect civilians are done so not under the flag of any particular country, but that the international community is stepping in. And so our teams will be in continuing discussions in the weeks ahead as we monitor the situation as it unfolds. All right? Thank you very much, everybody."", ""All right. We've been listening in to the president of the United States and also the president of Russia, Medvedev, the two men talking mainly about the relationship the economic relationship between the two countries and the importance of it moving forward. President Medvedev, in this neck of the woods, if you will, because he's going to be attending the G-8 and G-20 summits happening in Toronto in Canada over the weekend, but having to stopping by to speak with President Obama today. Also, speaking of news out of Toronto, out of canada for the G-8 and G-20, we're just getting word about a car. Now, a man is in custody, but he had a car that was apparently filled with all kinds of stuff that you don't want near the G-20 site when you have all these world leaders about to collect there for the weekend. Police there are telling us that, in fact, this car had pellet guns, gas tanks, a cross bow, and other chemical products in the vehicle. When the man was pulled over -- and this is video we can share with you now, but it gives you kind a close-up, an idea of how just much stuff was in this man's vehicle. But this was near the G-20 site. For whatever reason, something suspicious and an officer there decided to pull over this man who had all the stuff in the car and he couldn't give a good reason for why all of it was in there. But just take a look here. Again, this is the first we've been able to take a look at these pictures, but he had all of this stuff in the car. Again, police there telling us, investigators, he couldn't give a good reason for why all of that stuff was in his vehicle. He has been taken into custody. Don't have an idea of what the charges may be. Here, other new video we're just getting in, showing you the vehicle. And again, you have a number of world leaders, not just the heads of state, but they have so deputies and others that will be accompanying them to this G- 8, G-20 Summit happening up in Toronto, but you have a number of people up there, important folks, it's always a security nightmare. You always see often times protests and other things that break out around these summits, but this certainly calls for alarm. Our Jeanne Meserve following this story for us. Jeanne, what else can you tell us here? We're just now seeing some of these pictures. It's pretty remarkable what this man had in his vehicle."", ""Well T.J. it's really unclear at this point whether this man posed any kind of threat at all to the summit. Let me show you this car behind me. You can see that it has this makeshift car carrier on the top. It looks like it's homemade. It's attached to the car only with ropes. Police here, of course, are on very high alert because of the summits. They pulled the car over to investigate. Police tell me when they did, they could see the gas cans inside the car. They asked the man for an explanation. He was unable to give them one that satisfied them, so they investigated further. They opened up that car-top carrier, they looked in the car, they founded the loaded cross bow, they found pellet guns, they also found a lot of other things, I should add, suitcases, we cans see it looks like there are blankets in the back, it looks like there were plastic bags which may be full of the man's possessions. He's 53 years old. We don't have his identity yet. They have taken him off to be questioned. They've also have taken off a dog who was also in the car with him to make sure the animal's taken care of. But it's unclear, really unclear at this point in time exactly what was going on here. Hazmat teams are taking a closer look at those gas cans and what's inside to try to determine if it poses any kind of a threat. But you can see here that the cordoned off area is not tremendously big. They are letting us quite close to this vehicle at this point in time. And let me explain all the loud noise. Those are the demonstrators. There have been demonstrations through this city today and there's a small labor one going on here. So that's all the noise. Back to you."", 'And again, Jeanne, we have no idea why this stuff might have been in the car, but explain to people or remind them just what kind of a security nightmare an event like this is, to have all these heads of state collected in one place. And quite frankly, the police will always be on edge with anything that raises suspicion.', ""You're breaking up on me just a little bit, but I believe you asked me to give you the big security picture. This is a phenomenal security operation here. About 20,000 police, security guards, and military involved in securing these economic summits. A lot of fencing has gone up downtown. There are new cameras that have been put up here. Some of the police officers here, they're roving through the streets on bicycles and on foot. All through the city, to act as a deterrent to try and prevent any violent demonstrations from breaking out. A lot of peaceful demonstrations, though. We were with some indigenous people that marched through a lot of downtown today. They were flanked by police the whole time they marched. There were absolutely no incidents that we were aware of. Things have been very peaceful so far, but they're very much on the lookout here, hoping that this heavy police presence will serve as a deterrent. Back to you."", ""All right. And I'm going to take a chance that you can't hear me. You said I was breaking up a little bit, but hopefully you can hear me now. We're talking about this one incident with this man now. Have there been others so far associated with this particular summit? You talk about the protests. We expected to see those, but anything else that we've seen?"", ""Yes, we did see one other person taken into court yesterday. It was a man who, according to police, had some weapons, had some explosives. They have very strict privacy laws here in Canada. We don't know a lot about the incident yet. We may learn more as time goes on. Back to you."", ""All right. Jeanne Meserve for us on the scene. We thank you so much. Again the update there from our Jeanne Meserve, telling us that, in fact, we don't know this man's intent. We do not know a motive. We don't know why he might have had all this stuff in his vehicle. It might have been, quite frankly, something without a nefarious intent, but for police there who are getting set for the G-8 and the G-20 summit in Toronto, this is a collection of the heads of state and some of the biggest super powers in this country all collecting there over the weekend and it's always a security nightmare and they're not taking any chances. Again, the man is 53 years old, we don't know his name just yet, but according to investigator there is, he at least did not give them a sufficient enough reason or excuse for why he would have all this stuff in his vehicle. Chemicals, a crossbow, you saw chains there, you saw all kinds of other things sitting out on the street. Had gasoline canisters as well. Certainly calls for alarm. We will continue to monitor that story, but for now, man in custody, don't know why he had that stuff, but right now police are checking it out. That's it for me today, T.J. Holmes sitting in of Ali Velshi time for me to hand it over to RICK'S LIST.""]","['T.J. HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR', 'GEN.

CNN-165607,THE SITUATION ROOM,2011-5-2,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1105/02/sitroom.02.html,,Mission to Kill Osama bin Laden,"['And to our viewers, you\'re in THE SITUATION ROOM. Happening now, breaking news. Gripping new details are emerging right now of the bold and risky operation that took out Osama bin Laden, the gun battle that raged from room to room, a woman used by bin Laden as a human shield. We go inside the deadly raid. Stand by. Also the courier, the courier who inadvertently led the U.S. to bin Laden. We\'re getting new information right now about what officials are calling classic espionage and surveillance work. And one White House official says -- and I\'m quoting now -- ""It\'s unconceivable"" that bin Laden didn\'t have some kind of support system inside Pakistan. So what did officials in that country really know? I will ask the Pakistani ambassador to the United States. He\'s joining us live this hour. We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. Breaking news, political headlines, Jeanne Moos all straight ahead. I\'m Wolf Blitzer. You\'re in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let\'s begin this hour with the breaking news, new information about the U.S. special forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden. We have learned now that the code name assigned to the world\'s most wanted terrorist in this operation, the code name that the U.S. used for bin Laden was Geronimo. Also, a U.S. official tells CNN a recording from bin Laden may be released soon, a tape made before he was killed with the intention that his supporters would distribute it upon his death and presumably inspire them. We\'re also getting a firsthand look inside the White House where the terror leader, the decision was made to take him out. This ABC News video, by the way, showed a blood-stained room and evidence of the gun battle that took place inside that compound in Pakistan. New details of the operation continue to emerge. Our Pentagon correspondent Chris Lawrence is following all of this for us. All right, Chris, what\'s the very latest?', ""Well, Wolf, we have now learned that the national security team was able to see some real- time video of this assault taking place from the White House Situation Room. The assault involved four choppers, about two dozen commandos, and they were in and out within 40 minutes. But that's because this special ops team practiced assaulting a mock compound several times. And they were told going in, don't expect these people to surrender. They will fight you hard. 7 And true to that, Osama bin Laden died with a gun in his hand."", ""For years, everyone assumed Osama bin Laden would live out his days or die in the rugged mountains along the Afghan border. For all intents and purposes, he was killed in the suburbs, less than 40 miles from where the president of Pakistan lives. There are no rocky caves near bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, but there are golf courses and the Pakistan Military Academy. And his house was eight times bigger than any home in the neighborhood."", 'Thinking about that from a visual perspective, here is bin Laden, who has been calling for these attacks, living in this million-dollar-plus compound; living in an area that is far removed from the front.', ""The three-story building was built about six years ago. A courier and his brother lived on the first floor of another building. Bin Laden's family occupied the top two floors of the main building. Unlike other neighbors who took their trash out, these people burned theirs inside the compound. And if two main gates weren't enough to discourage visitors opaque windows shielded the inside. And there was an 18-foot wall surrounding the outer part of the compound. It stood out. And a U.S. intelligence official says, given how bad al Qaeda's finances are, they would only spend this kind of money for one of their top two commanders. So, in effect, bin Laden was the engineer of his own destruction. That end began with U.S. military helicopters swooping in, an assault team entering from multiple locations. A team of Navy SEALs fast- roped down to the ground, searching for Geronimo, their code name for bin Laden."", ""And they're going room to room, very methodical, engaging targets and completing the mission. But it's a really intense, personal, you know, up-close-and-personal type of operation."", 'High above, multiple American planes and unmanned drones were flying just outside Pakistani airspace, ready to fire if the team needed help. CIA Director Leon Panetta was quarterbacking the mission in constant secure radio contact with the assault team. And back at the White House, the president was anxiously monitoring events. Few officials even said a word.', 'The minutes passed like days. And the president was very concerned about the security of our personnel.', ""Back on the ground, the assault team was fighting its way through the main building. Two women were wounded in the firefight and there were children inside. At one point, one of the residents grabbed Osama bin Laden's wife, against her will."", 'She fought back. When there was the opportunity to get to bin Laden, she was positioned in a way that indicated that she was being used as a shield.', 'She was shot and died. The SEALs killed the two men defending bin Laden and his son. Even bin Laden himself shot back. But with a shot to the head, the SEALs took him out. While all this was going on, one of the U.S. helicopters had trouble. The team made the call to destroy it there on the ground and hustled the women and children out before detonating the aircraft.', ""And we're told there was an audible sigh in the Situation Room by the national security team when that team did make it out safely with bin Laden's body. And there was also sheer awe at what they had just been able to accomplish. Now, they didn't spend that entire 40 minutes fighting. Some of that time was spent collecting papers and material, what one intelligence official calls a robust amount of information and intelligence that they now hope to exploit to go after other members of al Qaeda -- Wolf."", ""I hope it helps them find the number-two leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahri. He remains at large. Good report, Chris. Thank you. Bin Laden's death is certainly a crippling blow to the terror network, but not necessarily a fatal one.

Mudd and other experts say, with so many jihadists having looked to bin Laden for operational direction, for inspirational command, filling his void will be a disjointed, messy undertaking.

No one should think the war on terrorism is over.', ""Yes. But history just speeded up for al Qaeda. Yes, look, the war on terror will never be over, in the sense there will be always people who are attracted to this ideology.

If we sat down and thought about it for a long time, Fran, we couldn't come up with anything better than those two things."", 'You heard Chris Lawrence, our Pentagon reporter, say, before they left, during the 40 minutes that the U.S. intelligence, special operations forces were in that compound, they went and collected a whole bunch of information, documents.

They have got to work that right now.', ""There's -- I think it is fair to say, Wolf, there was much more there than was anticipated. There's a trove. It is not just -- there were computers, although they were not hooked to the Internet. There were documents. There were DVDs. This is a multimedia exercise. They put a task force together to go through it. First and foremost, the first order of business is to identify any ongoing threats, especially to the United States or to our interests around the world. Second -- the second order of business will be to look for other high-value targets, like Zawahri."", 'his number two, Ayman al-Zawahri. Bin Laden was a relatively cautious guy.

And they -- he used the word boatload of intelligence that they picked up, DVDs, CD-ROMs, a lot of stuff, much more stuff than they anticipated, knowing that bin Laden was avoiding electronic communication because of concerns about being tracked. Yes, this guy is a paranoid and secretive guy. But don't forget, it's been 10 years now. It's a long time to accumulate a lot of stuff. And he's somebody who is very interested in what's going on, on the world. And probably, over time, you accumulate a lot of stuff. There were other people in there. Clearly, as Fran said, the main priority is trying to make sure that there are not other plots that are -- that you can sort of suss out from what's there. But, yes, I think this is unexpected."", 'Were you surprised that he was in a compound, in a mansion only a two-hour drive from Islamabad, as opposed to a cave in some of those -- that mountainous area, that tribal area in the northwest part of Pakistan?', ""Well, Wolf, as you know, we believed for a long time he was in that mountainous tribal area and moving around. It actually makes perfect sense that bin Laden would have made the deliberate decision. We know that the building of this mansion started five years ago. And what did bin Laden know? He knew at that time five years ago that there was an increasing use by the U.S. government of these Predator drones mostly used in rural areas. Very hard to use them in urban built-up areas like he was in, because you worry about collateral damage. Second, the other thing he would have known, Wolf, was the fact that there was a real dispute, including going back to the Bush administration. The Pakistani government did not want the U.S. government to put military boots on the ground inside Pakistan. And this public rift between the two governments was quite public. And so, if you're bin Laden, you know now from those two points of data, to avoid the drones, you want to get into an urban area, and you want to get away from where we have our troops stationed in Afghanistan. And, so, he was a good -- he was several hours away from the Afghan border."", ""Do you have any sense if we're going to spend the next 10 years looking for the number-two, now the number-one al Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahri?"", ""Actually, I doubt it, Wolf. And I would be interested to see what Fran thinks. I mean, Ayman al-Zawahri historically has taken much -- many more risks than bin Laden. We have already five video -- audiotapes from him discussing the recent events in the Middle East. Every time you release one of these tapes, you open yourself to the possibility a courier can be picked up, some kind of electronic trace, if you put it up on a jihadi Web site. So, Ayman al-Zawahri -- in fact, in 2006, the U.S. almost killed Ayman al-Zawahri in a drone attack in an area called Damadola in Northwestern Pakistan. So, I don't think it will be as long as Ayman al-Zawahri. And, also, it's less significant. We wouldn't be having this conversation if Ayman al-Zawahri has been killed. It would be significant, but not sort of seismic."", 'Fran?', ""That's right. And unlike bin Laden, where there was a long period of no intelligence or no sightings of him, Zawahri has been sighted. There has been intelligence. There have been targeting opportunities. He's come close several times. So, I expect this is not nearly as difficult..."", 'Yes. Not only Ayman al-Zawahri but, a lot of other bad guys out there are very, very nervous based on what the U.S. has done right now.', ""That's right. That's a good thing, Wolf."", 'I think you make a good point. Thank you.', ""We're also learning new information about the long trail that ultimately led to bin Laden and how one trusted courier was the key to finding him. And serious new questions about what Pakistan knew about bin Laden's presence inside Pakistan. I will put some of those questions to the country's ambassador to the United States. He's standing by to join us live here in THE SITUATION ROOM."", 'Osama bin Laden was certainly a fixture on the FBI list of the 10 most wanted terrorists for a decade. And within hours of word of his death, the agency updated his listing with a red banner reading ""Deceased.""

There\'s no word whether any of that bounty will actually be paid out. Let\'s go to Jack Cafferty. He\'s got ""The Cafferty File."" Amazing, Jack, amazing developments.', ""The terror attacks of September 11, 2001 were unlike anything most Americans had ever seen before. Three thousand innocent people murdered in cold blood on our own soil, it was an event that saddened and terrified the entire country. But it also unified us in a way that we hadn't been maybe since the end of the Second World War. Sadly, that unity was short-lived. We've been a pretty divided nation since soon after 9/11. The partisan politics that have taken over Washington over the past few years have made things increasingly ugly in this country. But last night, with the news that Osama Bin Laden had been killed, Americans were once again united. They converged on the streets of Lower Manhattan near Ground Zero and outside the White House in Washington. There was singing and dancing and waving American flags. There was a sense of victory, but a sense of remembrance too. We haven't seen this sort of patriotism and sense of victory and justice in a very long time. The United States hasn't had much success in the wars that we've gotten involved in since World War Two. That was the last one we won outright. It's been pointed out that both Osama bin Laden and Adolf Hitler were declared dead on the same day, May 1, more than 65 years apart, bin Laden yesterday courtesy of U.S. special forces. Hitler turned a gun on himself when he realized his dreams of world domination for Germany were a lost cause. In the end, he was just another little coward. Here's the question. Historically, what does the killing of Osama bin Laden compare to in your memory? Go to CNN.com/caffertyfile and post a comment on my blog. Momentous event."", ""Yes. Good question, Jack. I appreciate it. Thank you. Let's bring in our senior political analyst, Gloria Borger. She is learning some new details about the intelligence that let to bin Laden. What are your sources telling you right now, Gloria?"", ""Well, Wolf, this is such a complex and circuitous story, which begins many years ago, when intelligence officials started interviewing those high-value detainees, like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. And they had names of couriers. And they would throw them out and they would get some answers or try and get the names of couriers out. And there was one name where they were only given the nickname, the nom de guerre. And I think it's fair to assume that people clammed up. It's fair to assume that one of the detainees who may have clammed up was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed himself, because this courier turns out to be his protege and turns out to be the courier they tracked down, took them many years. That led them eventually to the compound. So there's the connection with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. It's a long trail, Wolf. It went cold for a couple of years. They finally figured out his name in another part of the world, then actually had a sighting of him, but they couldn't trail him openly, and eventually led to the compound, which they found very suspicious, as you know, which eventually led them to Osama bin Laden's nest on the third floor."", ""And they -- they didn't even know for sure that it was bin Laden who was hiding out in there."", 'No, they did not.', ""They didn't want to just send a missile in there because they wanted that body to confirm once and for all that they had killed bin Laden."", ""In talking to sources about this, I was told that the CIA believed that the probability of finding bin Laden there was 60 percent to 80 percent. I was told by a senior administration official there was no guarantee by any stretch. But, still, the president, and I believe that the CIA director, Leon Panetta, agreed that it would be best to go in with a helicopter rather than bomb the place, because, of course, if you were going to get bin Laden, you wanted a body. You wanted proof. You wanted to know that you had actually killed him. And that's why they decided to do it this way."", 'If they would have just sent a missile, a Hellfire missile or a Tomahawk cruise missile, you might never have known that bin Laden was dead.', 'Right. And this way, they have DNA. They have family match. And they know who it is.', ""And that's that."", 'Right.', ""Gloria, thank you. Bin Laden, as we say, was hiding in plain sight in a Pakistani city that had a big military presence, even its own version of West Point. So, does Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, have a lot to answer for about bin Laden? Stick around. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM."", ""The killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. special forces is certainly a defining moment for President Obama, also for a country scarred by the horrors of 9/11.

It\'s one of those times where, you know, I was laying in bed and all of a sudden saw you, and, you know, something was coming. And I probably, like you, thought, it\'s got to be Osama bin Laden, because you don\'t wake a country up at 11:30 at night to talk about what has already happened in Libya. So, quite a moment. I want you to take a look, talking about that, at a ""TIME"" magazine cover from 66 years ago this week marking the death of Adolf Hitler. Now, here\'s the cover of this week\'s special edition of ""TIME"" coming out Thursday. It is pictorial proof that this is exactly what we think it is, a very big deal, a moment to remember.', 'Ten years and more than 7,000 miles from New York City, Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and the Pentagon, U.S. Navy SEALs raided a mansion complex in Abbottabad, Pakistan, delivering the moment.', 'After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.', ""It was breathtaking and the moment of Barack Obama's presidency so far. Criticized as naive and timid in foreign policy, President Obama was steely in the crunch, approving a risky U.S.-only mission inside a sovereign country. Imagine if it had all gone wrong. Instead, we're told it all went right."", 'A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties.', 'This will help him politically because it helps Americans psychologically. Their moment is his and vice versa. Jim Deloughery lost a brother-in-law and cousin on 9/11.', ""It helps. It helps. But it's not going to bring him back. But it helps."", 'Bob Lynch just got back from duty in Afghanistan.', 'I was awestruck. I was relieved. This part -- this portion this that started so long ago is over.', 'It was as though 10 years of grief, anger and frustration were given some relief, a moment that produced a rock concert atmosphere near Ground Zero in New York City, Pennsylvania, and outside the White House gates. However heinous the person, there is something dystonic, uncomfortable about celebrating a death. It was a mixed moment for the mother of a fallen fireman.', ""It's good to see an evil person receive justice, but it's very bitter to realize that so many good people met a brutal and needless death at the hands of this monster."", 'Osama bin Laden brought us to a place where we are told to report suspicious activities at airports, train stations, even malls. He sparked the global battle against the unknown and the unthinkable in a struggle with no boundaries, and for a decade, the U.S. has lived with two wars that defy the standard definition of victory. So perhaps this is a celebration of clarity in a world where there is little. Our guys killed a bad guy. Winston Churchill once said of a key battle victory, ""Now, this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."" Whatever it is or will become, this is a moment to take notice.', ""And also quite a moment for the CIA and the armed services. I spoke with one top Pentagon official today who told me what satisfies him the most is that, in Osama bin Laden's final moment, the last thing he saw was the face of the U.S. military."", 'What political implications, fallout do you expect from this, Candy?', 'Listen, I think that you will see President Obama get a huge boost. I mean, you know, presidents take the rap for things that go wrong. They get credit for things that go well. This went really well. He\'s going to get a lot of credit. What is -- what\'s it going to do a year and half from now? It depends on what the moments are between now and then. You know that. We\'ve seen so many presidents who thought -- we thought about a year and a half, ""Ooh, they are a shoo-in,"" or ""Boy, this really -- they\'ll never get re-elected,"" and -- and then they are, because there\'s a lot of moments in the presidency.', ""George Herbert Walker Bush back in '91, '92 after the first Gulf War, his approval numbers were -- were terrific. And then you know what happened."", ""And then he lost. I remember Ronald Reagan and the bombing of the troops in Lebanon. And I thought, well, that's it. That's over. He'll never win re-election. And of course, he did."", ""He did, of course. All right, Candy, thanks very much. All right. We're just getting some new details about the U.S. raid that killed bin Laden. Let's go straight to our senior White House correspondent, Ed Henry. What are you hearing, Ed?"", 'Well, Wolf, one senior administration official now telling us that Osama bin Laden was shot twice, that he was actually shot in the chest first, and then in the head. We had previously only learned that he had been shot in the head. He was also shot in the chest. Also some new information from this senior information official that, in fact, Osama bin Laden\'s wife was not killed and not used as a human shield. That was some of the initial information that was being reported on yesterday. Now this official saying that, because of the fog of war, because of varying accounts, instead this was another woman, not Osama bin Laden\'s wife, who was caught in the crossfire. It\'s unclear now whether or not she really was used as a human shield. Meanwhile, Osama bin Laden\'s wife was wounded, we believe hit in the calf, according to the senior official, but not killed and is still now in Pakistan, was not taken away by U.S. officials. Another important detail coming in from a second senior administration official is that when President Obama and some of his top aides were here, that dramatic scene we\'ve been talking about in the White House situation room yesterday afternoon and evening as they were watching these events in Pakistan unfold in that secure area of the White House situation room, we\'re told now the president and his aides heard someone on the ground in Pakistan say this phrase, ""Geronimo, E-K-I-A."" As in ""Geronimo, enemy killed in action."" Why that\'s significant, is we\'re now learning that ""Geronimo"" is the code name that the U.S. officials were privately using for either capturing or killing bin Laden. That was not the name for bin Laden himself but the code for actually capturing or killing him. So what the president of the United States heard in the situation room was someone in Pakistan saying ""Geronimo E-K-I-A,"" as in enemy killed in action. Finally, after the firefight that we\'ve heard about, we\'re now hearing from the senior administration official that the president and a lot of top aides sat around the conference table in the White House situation room. In some pictures today of that scene. And after they went through the facial recognition, after they went through Osama bin Laden\'s wife, saying on the ground that that was in fact Osama bin Laden, there was a big debate going on, we\'re told, among these officials as to whether or not they should now announce to the world, start briefing congressional leaders and others that, in fact, Osama bin Laden was killed. We\'re told as this debate was going on, the president of the United States finally interjected and said simply, ""We got him."" He made the decision as commander in chief, after hearing all this debate, hearing the information that was coming in, that this, in fact, was Osama bin Laden. That set everything in motion. This scene played out last night before the world learned it, Wolf.', ""And two other points. I'm picking up from authoritative U.S. sources saying to me -- I assume you've got this as well. Bin Laden did not actually personally fire back. Did you hear the same thing?"", 'That\'s right. And in fact, we\'re now hearing from a senior administration official that they do not believe that Osama bin Laden reached for a weapon. There was some suggestion in early reports that maybe he was and maybe that\'s why he got shot. But we\'re told now that he did not have a weapon; he didn\'t fire anything. Also we\'re learning that late on Thursday night, as we go through the timeline now, a little bit more detail, there was a big briefing here privately at the White House. The president went through all the options with the commander about what could be done, what could not be done. And he wanted to sleep on it, basically. Friday morning, we\'ve already known that the president gave the authorization to move forward with this mission. The new piece of information we\'re getting is that, as all this was going around the table and they were trying to figure all this out on Friday morning, the president after waking up, came down and basically said to his staff, ""It\'s a go."" And they went through the options again and he interrupted and said, ""It\'s a go."" He had made up his mind between Thursday night into Friday morning, when they were waiting for him in the diplomatic room. He told them, ""It\'s a go,"" and that\'s what set everything in motion, Wolf.', ""The other point that I was told is, contrary to some of the earlier reports, information we were getting from U.S. officials, the Navy SEALs did not come down from those helicopters on what's called that fast rope. They lower a rope. Then they climb down. They -- apparently, the helicopters just landed. Did you pick up that at your briefing?"", ""I have not heard that specific piece of information yet. But what I do have that sort of fits into that -- and the reason why, so our viewers understand, why we're piecing through this bit by bit is that one senior administration official told me, basically, that because of the fog of war there is some confusion about some of those specific details. And what's going on right now is each one of these Special Forces are being interviewed by authorities to get their own accounts. Each person in this firefight as we're describing it, saw different things from different sides of the room, from outside the compound, inside the compound. Interesting final note is that this senior administration official was telling me that they believe Osama bin Laden was actually in this compound for at least three years, maybe even longer. We know that this compound in Pakistan was completed in 2005. This official saying they now believe inside the administration that the compound was built for bin Laden. So he could have been there as far back as 2005. So all this suggestion out there maybe he was hiding in a cave, whatever, no, he may have been in this compound now for several years, Wolf."", ""All right. Well, excellent reporting. Thanks very much for all that information. The latest information from our senior White House correspondent, Ed Henry.

If you remember, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was found in a similar house in the city of Rawalpindi a few years ago, and the Pakistani government was responsible for arresting him at that time. What I find incredulous is the notion that somehow, just because there is a private support network in Pakistan, the state, the government and the military of Pakistan should be blamed."", ""Because we have high respect for the military, the intelligence service. You can disagree with them, but they're very good. Listen to this interview I did on April 12, 2010, about a year ago or so, with your prime minister, Prime Minister Gillani. Here's some excerpts."", 'Are you any closer right now, do you believe, to finding, to capturing or killing Osama bin Laden or his No. 2, Ayman al-Zawahiri?', 'In fact, Osama bin Laden is not in Pakistan.', ""How do you know for sure he's not in Pakistan?"", ""Because our military actions are very successful, and we have a very successful operation in Malakar (ph) and Swat and now in South Waziristan and elsewhere. If there would have been any chance, he would have been arrested or maybe even don't know whether he's alive or not."", 'It sounds to me like Prime Minister Gillani was in total denial of what was going on.', ""Look, we have to as a nation in Pakistan re-evaluate our view of this whole problem. After 911, there were people in Pakistan who said we shouldn't side with the United States because the United States is about to crumble like the Soviet Union did and we should actually support the Taliban. You remember that. That changed. Pakistan has to come to terms with the fact and we will."", 'But Mr. Ambassador, he was within a two-hours drive of Islamabad.', 'Wolf, that is not the point. The point is that he has been eliminated in a successful operation by the United States, and Pakistan has expressed satisfaction at the conclusion of this operation.', 'Let me ask...', 'And any question about intelligence failures will definitely be addressed by us jointly. As I said only two or three days ago in your program, we are allies. We want...', ""Why didn't the U.S. trust Pakistan to share anything about this operation until all those U.S. troops were out of your air space?"", ""Because the United States didn't share information on this operation with the Australians, with the British, with the Canadians. It did not because..."", 'He was in Pakistan, not in Australia or Britain.', 'But my point is that the United States made a critical decision. President Obama decided that the success of the operation was far more important than the niceties. And that said -- that said...', ""But even when those helicopters were flying back to Afghanistan or to the Indian -- they still didn't tell you until you were -- they were completely out of your air space."", ""Pakistan and the United States have a lot of things to work out as we move forward, but move forward we will. Pakistan has no interest, the people of Pakistan have no interest in protecting our keeping terrorists on our soil. We need to build our nation. Half our children don't go to school. Two-thirds of our people live below the poverty line. Those are the issues we want to address."", ""Bottom line, you're happy bin Laden is dead?"", 'You bet. I have -- I have wanted bin Laden not to be on the scene for a long time. The terrorists have brought Islam a bad name. They have brought Pakistan a bad name. They have brought all our neighboring countries a bad name, and we want to defeat them as much as you and any American.', 'Mr. Ambassador, thanks for coming in. We\'ll continue this conversation.

What impact will this new unemployment picture have on the race for the White House? Also, Mitt Romney gets grilled Southern-style on talk radio. Details of an aggressive interview highlight his challenges in the next week primaries. Plus, a flight attendant's disturbing outburst forces a plane to turn back. We have the frightening moments caught on tape. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. The politics of unemployment swirling today as President Obama and the Republicans try to spin the latest jobless numbers to their political advantage. While the president is highlighting new signs of economic strength, the Republicans are spotlighting the unemployment level that remains unchanged despite solid job growth. CNN White House correspondent Dan Lothian has more in Prince George County in Virginia -- Dan."", 'Wolf, the president came here today because he says Rolls-Royce and its jet engines are helping to boost the U.S. economy, 140 new jobs expected here, another hundred at a plant in Indiana. But it was also a chance for him to cheer the latest job numbers that he says proves the U.S. economy is on the right track, even though not everyone agrees. (voice-over): The U.S. employment picture is far from sunny. But the better-than-expected February job numbers seem to have pushed a few more dark clouds out of the way. President Obama expressed optimism.', 'The economy is getting stronger.', ""The U.S. Labor Department reports 227,000 jobs added nationwide. That's the third straight month of job growth above 200,000."", ""In the past, corporations were experiencing record profits and sitting on record amounts of cash, over $2 trillion. Now they have enough confidence that they're beginning to invest."", 'And 31,000 of those jobs were added in manufacturing alone, yet the unemployment rate remains unchanged at 8.3 percent, and across the country, there is frustration.', ""I came to Madison thinking that I can get a job quicker and faster, but it hasn't been the case."", 'Republicans were quick to highlight the unemployment number in this e-mail from the RNC, with the subject line -- quote -- ""The Big Fail: Your Best Isn\'t Good Enough."" President Obama argues that the economy was far worse than expected when he took office. As he highlighted recent gains while visiting a Rolls-Royce jet engine facility in Prince George, Virginia, the president made the case for manufacturing as a way to grow the ailing U.S. economy.', ""America thrives when we build things better than the rest of the world. I want us to make stuff here and sell it over there. I don't want the stuff made over there and selling it over here."", ""The president is proposing $1 billion in grants to set up regional institutes focused on research and development. And he's pushing in-sourcing, where companies bring jobs back to the"", 'The work that is done at this facility could be done in a lot of locations around the world. We have found that we can compete because of this model that allows us to be very, very competitive. It allows us to innovate.', ""In a presidential election that is likely to be decided on the health of the economy, there is pressure to make significant gains, even as Republican opponents argue that the administration's policies are doing more harm than good. (on camera): In a statement, House Speaker John Boehner said the jobs numbers are encouraging for struggling families and businesses, but that the unemployment number is far too high. He called on the Senate to take action on their jobs act -- Wolf."", 'Dan Lothian with the president in Virginia. Let\'s dig a little bit deeper right now with our chief economics and business correspondent, Erin Burnett, the host of ""ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT."" Erin, today\'s numbers pretty good numbers, very good numbers by some definition, but there could be some pitfalls for the president and for the U.S. economy in the month ahead. What are you looking at?', ""Well, this is interesting. Last fall, a lot of people thought we might have a double dip recession. Our economic strike team at the time had said no, things are really getting better, and it turned out they were right. The past few months obviously have been incredibly strong for job creation. A 12-month average, the president has seen 168,000 jobs on average per month, so that is good, but there are some real questions. And it's not just things like whether Europe gets significantly weaker, which really could affect the United States. Take the Iran situation that is so important and significant and we don't know what will happen over the next few months. If that remains just tense, you already have $10 to $15 per barrel in crude oil prices. We all know prices are just shy of $4 a gallon nationwide. That is something that takes a real bite out of consumers' pockets. We did some analysis today. If that situation gets worse, remains tense, the Straits of Hormuz where 20 percent of the world's oil goes through for example are shut down by Iran as tensions rise, you could see oil prices go back to their highs of $150 a barrel. That's $5 a gallon in the United States, and if there were real strikes, any sort of military conflict, you could see, even if only briefly, oil prices to $200 a barrel and that would be $7 at the pump. These are real questions marks. The Iran situation has very, very real economic implications and that matters for the president's reelection prospects."", ""Erin, stand by for a moment. I want you to join me in the questioning to Alan Krueger. He's chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. He's joining us live from the White House right now. Alan Krueger, react to what Erin just said, that there are these enormous potential pitfalls in the months ahead."", ""Well, sure. We have faced risks all along in this recovery. There have been headwinds coming from natural disasters in Asia, from turmoil in the Middle East last year. Nonetheless, the recovery has been resilient. We have had economic growth for two-and-a-half years. We have now had 24 straight months of private sector job growth, 1.3 million jobs added in the last six months, which is the most since 2006. So the economy has been resilient. The increase in oil prices, gasoline prices is difficult for families who were already having difficulty with their budgets. I think, for that reason, it's fortunate that Congress followed the president's request and extended the payroll tax cut, which is putting more money in people's pockets."", 'All right, but just listen quickly to what Mitt Romney said today out on the campaign trail. Listen to this. We will get your reaction.', 'This president, how many months ago was it, 37 months ago, told us that if he could borrow $787 billion, almost a trillion dollars, he would keep unemployment below 8 percent. It has not been below 8 percent since.', 'Does he have a point?', ""No. The economy was in horrific shape when President Obama walked into the Oval Office. GDP was falling at a much greater rate than had been announced. At the time, we thought GDP was falling at a 3.8 percent annual rate. It turned out to be 8.9 percent at the end of 2008. All of that conspired to cause such a deep recession, but the unemployment rate has been coming down, and we have had private sector job growth for 24 straight months. Since the president's policies were put in place, the economy is looking much, much better. And the president is going to stay at it. He's pleased that the economy has been expanding, that job growth has picked up, but he's going to keep at it until everyone who is looking for a job can find one."", 'All right, Erin, go ahead.', ""Mr. Krueger, I just wanted to ask you about one thing that stood out to me in the report this morning, and that was earnings, or the lack thereof in terms of earnings growth for average American workers. I guess, according to the numbers, up one-tenth of a percent, so, for the past year, that means the average American income went up by about 1.9 percent. That is below inflation. And obviously that means people's standard of living actually has gone down, rather than gone up. How big of a concern is that for you? I know, first and foremost, you have to be focused on this job growth, but this issue of a lack of wage growth has got to be considerable."", ""Well, we certainly like to see more income growth. And because more people are finding jobs, and because hours have increased -- since the end of the recession, the increase in work hours is the equivalent of adding about two million new workers, full-time equivalent workers. That's helped to raise income. There are headwinds for wage rates. When you have a recession, such a deep recession as we saw in 2008, early 2009, that does constrain wage growth, and those factors have been at work. But I think it's most important that we continue the policies that have helped to strengthen job growth over the past several months."", ""Are you doing anything special to help minorities right now? I will put some numbers up on the screen. As far as Hispanics are concerned, a year ago, the unemployment rate for American Hispanics 11.6 percent. Now it's down to 10.7 percent, but that's away above 8.3 percent, the national average. Among African- Americans, a year ago it was 15.4 percent. Right now, it's 14.1 percent. There's still some major issues, major problems not only for all Americans, but for minorities especially."", ""It's an excellent question, Wolf, and even before the recession, the unemployment rate was too high for minorities, especially for African-American and Hispanic workers. Hispanic workers, especially male Hispanic workers, were hit hard by the over-building of construction and the subsequent bust of residential construction. And the problems are a bit different in the African-American community. If you look at African-Americans, they tend to have relatively long spells of unemployment. And that was the case also if you go back before the recession. So the types of problems are different, but they both result in high unemployment. So what is the president doing? Well, he's been making a number of efforts to try to revive construction, to help make a transition so that we are on stronger footing in the housing market, also urging Congress to invest more in infrastructure, which would put construction workers back to work right now and help raise productivity in the future. And in addition to the efforts that the president announced today for manufacturing, there are other efforts to strengthen manufacturing, to raise overall job growth, which help both African- Americans and Hispanics, as well as to focus on people who have long- term unemployment to provide pathways back to work for the long-term unemployed, such as additional training and employment services, which should help both African-Americans and Hispanics."", 'Alan Krueger at the White House, thanks very much.', 'Thank you, Wolf.', ""Erin, let me just button up this conversation up with you. We're talking about pitfalls down the road, and obviously gasoline prices especially could skyrocket if there is a war let's say with Iran and oil shipments are curtailed through the Straits of Hormuz or whatever. But I'm also worried about what could happen in Europe, especially in Greece, and the fallout here. How worried should we be about that?"", ""It's a really significant concern. Europe obviously is the crucial trading partner for the United States. So it matters. If they really go into a deep recession, it dramatically affects our companies and jobs in America. Our banks also have a lot of loans out to Europe. So that is something that will come home to roost immediately, really could be a bit hit for the U.S. But in terms of the Greece situation, it's whether this plan will work for Greece. And beyond Greece, you have got Italy, you have got Spain, you have got Portugal. Europe has a lot of very big question marks out there. And if there are missteps, like I said, that's something that could very quickly come to roost right back in the United States. It is really not a foreign story. It's very much a domestic economic story for us too."", 'You will have a lot more I\'m sure at 7:00 Eastern, ""ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT."" And we will be watching. Erin, thanks, as usual.', 'OK, Wolf.', 'Mitt Romney tries some Southern charm in an effort to overcome his Southern challenges.', ""I'm learning to say y'all, and I like grits. And things are -- strange things are happening to me."", ""Strange, but wait until you hear the Southern grilling he got on an Alabama talk radio show. Also, a flight attendant's rant about a crash on 9/11 that left passengers shocked and frightened.""]","[""WOLF BLITZER, HOST, CNN'S THE SITUATION ROOM"", 'DAN LOTHIAN, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT', 'BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES', 'LOTHIAN', 'DANNY BOSTON, GEORGIA TECH', 'LOTHIAN', 'UNIDENTIFIED MALE', 'LOTHIAN', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'LOTHIAN', 'U.S. JAMES GUYETTE, CEO, ROLLS-ROYCE NORTH AMERICA', 'LOTHIAN', 'BLITZER', 'ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR', 'BLITZER', 'ALAN KRUEGER, CHAIRMAN, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS', 'BLITZER', 'MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE', 'BLITZER', 'KRUEGER', 'BLITZER', 'BURNETT', 'KRUEGER', 'BLITZER', 'KRUEGER', 'BLITZER', 'KRUEGER', 'BLITZER', 'BURNETT', 'BLITZER', 'BURNETT', 'BLITZER', 'ROMNEY', 'BLITZER']"

We\'re closely watching these stories for you right now. Whipping up the Eastern Seaboard, hurricane Sandy. It is a category 1 right now and most forecast models show it hitting the coast somewhere around the North Carolina-Virginia state line. Emergency agencies all the way up the coast to Maine bracing for high water, heavy winds and for the power to go out. Live pictures right now. Hurricane Sandy forcing the presidential candidates to rearrange their campaign travel plans. This is Tybee Island you\'re looking at. Mitt Romney has canceled rallies tomorrow in Virginia. He\'ll be in Ohio instead. And Vice President Biden was supposed to be in Virginia Beach today but had to call it off. President Obama campaigns in Florida tomorrow. Well, Ohio will be the focus over the next 10 days and the latest CNN/ORC poll shows why. Obama is leading 50 percent to 46 percent in our latest survey of likely voters. That\'s basically unchanged since earlier this month and well within the poll\'s sampling error. We\'re going to spend a lot of time this hour hearing from the first lady, Michelle Obama, and Mitt Romney\'s wife, Ann Romney. Two fascinating women and strong advocates for their successful and ambitious husbands. At the bottom of the hour, we\'re going to bring you a special of ""The Journey of Ann Romney."" She tells our own Gloria Borger that some people have the wrong impression of her husband.', ""There are a lot of charges about your husband. One of them is that he's somebody who has no core. That he's been on both sides of a lot of issues."", ""That's just to me like the most false charge there is, because I know his core."", 'What is his core?', ""Honesty, integrity, decency, intelligence, conviction to doing the right thing. And so for me, I've seen that in everything he's done. And he's exhibited it in every way that he's lived his life."", 'More from Mrs. Romney at the bottom of the hour here on CNN. In the meantime, the first lady, Michelle Obama, spoke with our chief White House correspondent Jessica Yellin. She says her husband, the president, is dedicated to helping all Americans.', ""What I can tell you about my husband is that he's been working to ensure that every American can have a real shot at the American dream. You know, that people can have a job that pays a decent wage. That people don't lose their homes because someone gets sick. You know, that you can send your kids to college maybe or maybe your kids can learn a trade and get a good job that pays benefits and that folks can retire with a little dignity and security."", ""Earlier this week, the first lady spoke in Florida preaching her husband's message in a vital swing state."", 'We believe in an America where all of us, where we understand that none of us gets where we are on our own, that we all have a community of people lifting us up, where we treat everyone, everyone with dignity and respect -- from the teachers who inspire us to the janitors who keep our schools clean. And in this America that we are building together, see, when one of us stumbles -- and we all stumble, when one of us falls on hard times, we don\'t turn our backs and say, tough luck, you\'re on your own. Not in our America. No, instead we extend a helping hand until they get back on their feet. In our America, we believe that the truth matters. So you don\'t take shortcuts. You don\'t game the system. You don\'t play by your own set of rules. And we also believe in keeping our priorities straight. See because we all know good and well that cutting ""Sesame Street"" is no way to balance our budget. We absolutely know better than that. We know that shortchanging our children is not how we tackle the deficit. If we want to build opportunities for all Americans, then, yes, we have to cut wasteful spending. But we also have to make smart investments in our future. Things like education and infrastructure for an economy built to last. That is what my husband stands for. That\'s the country he has been working to build for the last four years. Those are his values. And let me tell you as first lady, I have seen up close and personal just how critical those values are for leading this country. I have seen how the issues that come across a president\'s desk, they are always the hard ones. The decisions that aren\'t just about the bottom line, but they\'re about laying a foundation for the next generation. And I have seen how important it is to have a president who doesn\'t just tell us what we want to hear, but who tells us the truth even when it\'s hard, especially when it\'s hard.', 'And coming up, the first lady tells us about meeting the president, her marriage and spending her 20th anniversary on a double date with the Romneys.', ""Debate advice. What's it like on the trail? And spending your 20th anniversary on live television?

Nice to see you.', 'So nice to see you.', 'We sat down with Michelle Obama and her brother, Craig, before that first high stakes presidential debate. As the president told the world, it fell on a big day for the first couple.', 'There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago, I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. And so I just want to wish, sweetie, you, happy anniversary and let you know a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.', 'I wonder if in your wildest dreams you would ever imagine you would be spending your 20th wedding anniversary on a double date with the Romneys.', ""Yes, no, I can't say that this would have been the plan 20 years ago. And in fact, you know, I told Barack, you know, attending a presidential debate on my 20th anniversary is probably the worst way for me to spend -- I get so nervous at these debates. And, you know, I'm like one of those parents watching their kid on the balance beam. You're just standing there, just trying not to, you know, have any expression at all. So, no, I would not have chosen this but I'm excited about it. I know he's going to do a great job."", 'Craig was a groomsman in the wedding. (on camera): October 3rd two years ago, what were you doing that day?', ""That was my sister's wedding. I was having a lot of fun meeting Barack's family, his extended family, for the first time."", 'Tell me about the groom. Was he nervous?', ""No, I do remember that. He wasn't nervous. We were back in the back --"", 'He had a bad cold.', ""Yes, but we were joking around because he had a cold. And I remember thinking -- we were teasing him about, OK, whatever you do, don't sneeze while you are saying your vows, and I remember we had a big laugh about that."", 'He said all the congestion, he was really congested, when he got to the altar, it all cleared up, and for that moment we were at the altar, he said his nose was completely clear.', 'My sister has that affect on people.', 'Were you nervous?', ""No, I wasn't. I mean, this -- you know, Barack and I, we had dated for a couple of years. And I knew him and I trusted him. It was the most natural next step in the world, and our families knew each other. I had spent Christmases in Hawaii meeting his family. So, there wasn't -- you know, it was -- it was just sort of, OK, we're going to do this, get it done, and we'll go on our honeymoon. I was really excited about the honeymoon actually."", 'Let me ask you about the debate a little bit.', 'Yes.', ""I've read, before a speech, you to tell him have fun. A debate is a little different because it's more of a competition, more like a game of one- on-one. What's your motivational advice to him before the debate?"", ""You know, He doesn't need much advice. I mean, he's been doing this quite some time. He knows the job. He's been doing it quite some time. He's a very good debater."", 'All that was before we saw how the face-off in Denver would play out. Even the president has joked about his performance.', 'As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy in our second debate. I felt really well rested after the nice long nap I had in the first debate.', 'Some of his aides say one of his challenges to keep the answers short and I know that you -- have said that you critique his speeches afterward.', ""Oh, no, I don't afterwards actually. I give him, you know, I give him my positive reinforcement. So --"", 'Only positive?', ""Generally, yes because he's a great speaker, you know? I mean, he's good at this. So --"", 'So do you think he has any challenges going in?', ""You know, I haven't really -- I would have to think about that afterwards, but going into it, I think he's going to do his best."", 'The president offered his perspective in an ABC News interview after the first debate.', 'What did Mrs. Obama say to you when you got home that night?', 'You know what, Michelle is always my best advisor, my toughest critic. She and I have been through this together.', ""But the first lady didn't play critic with us. (on camera): Some aides say that you're the one person who can keep his ego in check. Is that true?"", ""You know, Barack doesn't have a big ego. You know, that's the thing. I mean, he is -- you see this in how he leads the country. I mean, he is very open to other people's opinions. And he's always willing to compromise. And he is always, always listening, you know? So that would kind of be the last thing that I would think of when I talk about my husband is big ego, because he just doesn't have that. So, it's not much to check."", 'And she got backup from Craig, a college basketball coach.', ""One of the first things I saw on the basketball court was his lack of ego. You know, the game wasn't about him. It was about the game. And it was about his teammates. And so, I don't think there's an ego to put in check."", 'Hard to believe about a president of the United States.', 'Not this one.', ""Well, the first lady a popular stand-in for the president on the campaign trail. But what is it like for the Obamas when they're not on the road? More from our exclusive interview with the first lady of the United States Michelle Obama."", ""You're watching a special hour here on CNN that's devoted to the biggest supports of presidential candidates -- their wives, of course. But what's life like for the first family when they're not on the campaign trail? Here's now more from our chief White House correspondent Jessica Yellin."", ""First Lady Michelle Obama is a fierce defender of her husband's administration. And these days a regular presence on the campaign trail. Target audience? Women. (on camera): You talk a lot about what your husband has done for women. At the same time, the number of women in poverty has grown during his time in office. It's now at a 17-year high. What is your message to those women?"", ""This election couldn't be more important for women on so many different issues. I mean, making sure women have equal pay is key to eliminating that gap in the economy. Now because of health care reform, women have access to preventative care. Things like breast cancer screenings and contraception. That's really critical. Making sure that their kids can stay on their health care until they're 26 years old, which is a relief to many mothers out there who have kids coming out of college or, you know, entering, you know, the workforce or the work world and having some kind of health care stability. I'm thinking about Malia and Sasha. I'm thinking about our daughters and granddaughters. So I for one am spending a lot of time out there talking to women to make sure they understand all that's on the line."", ""With so much on the line, the president has taken heat for failing to spend more time building relationships with leaders in Washington. In a recent interview, he told me why outreach isn't his top priority."", ""We make turn down the invitation to this or that or the other just because we're trying to carve out family time. And I think that's sometimes interpreted as me not wanting to, you know, be out there slapping backs and wheeling and dealing. I think it really has more to do with just the stage we are in our lives."", 'Do you think there are sometimes a downside to putting family first?', ""Oh, absolutely not. You know, I mean, gosh, that's at the core of this country. I mean, in the end, this is what we're here for. You know, we're here to make sure that we're giving every family an opportunity to have the kind of stability and, you know, opportunities for the future for themselves and for their kids. I think that there's no better thing to do than to model that in our own homes. I know that that's how we grew up."", ""Yes. We grew up that way. And, you know, what's amazing for me is to watch -- when I come to the White House, it's the White House. I mean, it's the White House. But inside, in the living quarters, watching my sister and the president operate with their family, it is -- it's refreshing, because the only thing that's different is they're in the White House."", 'It seems normal? A normal family?', ""Well, it doesn't seem normal."", 'Secret Service everywhere.', ""Well, no, it's the White House."", ""Because it's the White House."", ""So, it doesn't seem normal because we're from the south side of Chicago. But the behavior's all normal. Everything's the same. It's just inside the White House. It's just very down to earth and very loving."", 'Malia is a freshman in high school. I think driving is just around the corner.', 'Oh, gosh.', 'Have you given any thought to which one of you is getting in the car with her?', ""We're just -- this is like the third week of high school. You got to let me get through this first. But, you know, what I will say is that Barack and I, we've worked to make sure that our girls have a normal life even though they're the children of the president. So it's important for us to make sure that they have friends and sleepovers. They go to school. They do everything that kids do. So that has been our priority from day one. And we always check-in. I always check-in with Craig. It's like, do the girls seem like the girls you knew before we came to the White House."", ""That's exactly right. Maybe I'll come out and teach them to drive."", 'The president has called you the best mom in the world. And he says the girls are grounded and great. But no kid is perfect. So when the time calls for it, which one of you plays the heavy?', ""You know, this is the thing I like about Barack. He's not like the happy dad, you know. He's very good at reinforcing the rules and boundaries that we set. We never get into that but dad said. We're very good at not, you know, letting the kids play off of us. And Barack and I really do share the same values. It makes it easy. I think this is one of the reasons why our wedding was so much fun was because when our families got together, even though they were from all over the world, you had people from Kenya and people, you know, from Hawaii and people from Kansas and people from, you know, it was a melting pot. What connected was is that we all shared the same values. And our families got along instantly. So when it comes to raising kids, it helps having a partner who believes in the same thing -- respect, empathy, hard work, decency. You know, we're constantly telling our kids that the most important thing they can be is good decent people who treat other people with kindness and respect. So that's kind of the, you know, that's the overall governing principle in our household. So, we don't stray too far from it. And I don't have to worry about, you know, Barack not being, you know, a disciplinarian or me -- we balance each other out. Yes."", 'We have this reminder for you. Coming up at 7:30, make sure you tune in for our special report ""The Journey of Ann Romney."" But first a news update for you. States of emergency declared all along the East Coast. We\'re looking at what could be an unprecedented storm just days from the election.', 'Let\'s get you up to speed now on the top stories of the day. South Carolina, North Carolina beaches slammed by the outer bands of hurricane Sandy. The storm is creeping northward. And emergency crews are prepping for this large hurricane\'s landfall. We just learned that the state of New Jersey dropped the tolls on highways leading away from the coast. People from Maryland to Maine are urged to get inland as soon as possible. Hurricane Sandy is coming, everyone. The storm forced the presidential candidates to rearrange their travel plans. President Obama campaigns in Florida tomorrow away from the storm. And Mitt Romney has called off planned rallies in Virginia. He\'ll be in Ohio instead. Vice president Biden was supposed to be in Virginia beach today, but he canceled because of the weather. And this is just in to CNN, just a few details about a car accident today involving the daughter of Florida Senator Marco Rubio. This is the senator campaigning with candidate Mitt Romney earlier today. We carried some of it live here on CNN. According to a statement from Rubio\'s office, 12-year-old Amanda Rubio was airlifted to a Miami hospital where she is in stable condition. We\'ll get more details when we get them. But we are wishing for the best for the Rubio family. While Mitt Romney\'s quest for the White House has been well documented, Ann Romney\'s journey has been fascinating in its own right. Through a compilation of interviews with CNN\'s Gloria Borger, you will get a glimpse at her role in the campaign and how it\'s evolved. That\'s ""The Journey of Ann Romney"". It\'s right after this.', ""Ann Romney is not new to politics. This is her fourth political campaign. After her husband's last try for the presidency in 2008, she vowed never again. Then, she changed her mind and has gone from reluctant spouse to campaign warrior promoting and defending her husband at every turn. Her story is political, but also intensely personal as we learned when we sat down with her on the campaign trail and at the Romney's summer home in New Hampshire. Here's the journey of Ann Romney."", 'Ann Romney was there when her husband ended his run for the presidency in 2008 after a brutal primary fight.', 'Almost, but not quite.', 'Ann was done. (on camera): When it was over you made a home video, which said -', ""I will never do this again. I just made sure it was very emphatic. It was, again, a very bruising thing. I think people forget that these are real families with people that they love that are going through these hard times. And for me I was like, that's it. OK, we did that. That's fine. Never again. But it was me this time that was the most emphatic and the most determined that he should run again when it came time to think about running again."", 'So why the change of heart?', ""It was an endeavor that was worth doing and worth pursuing. This country was worth it. I felt like the country was in trouble. I felt like the skill set that Mitt has were unique to be able to do an economic turnaround. I also saw him being selfless in his entire life as a bishop in his congregation when my kids were young, and serving others all the time. And I saw that in him. I wish more people knew that about him. And what really makes him drive. Inside is this drive to help others. He's mistaken by a lot of people. By, you know, why he's doing this. But for me I know why he's doing it. I know he wants to get the country right."", 'So Ann Romney once the reluctant warrior marched right to the front lines. First, as the more conventional low profile spouse.', 'I want to introduce the man who we all believe should be the next president of the United States, Mitt Romney.', ""But soon enough Ann's voice became crucial. And her crusade very personal. Her job, nothing less than defining Romney."", 'This man will not fail.', ""There are, as you know in politics, there are a lot of charges about your husband. One of them is that he's somebody who has no core. That he's been on both sides of a lot of issues."", ""And that's just to me like the most false charge there is. Because I know his core."", 'What is his core?', ""Honesty, integrity, decency, intelligence, conviction to doing the right thing. And so for me, I've seen that in everything he's done. And he's exhibited it in every way that he's lived his life."", ""So what do you say to people who say he's a political opportunist?"", ""You see, that's the game of politics again. I know it's not true. But I also know that there will be attacks that will come our way continually that will be most of them false. And we're just going to have to just power through and just keep going."", 'And not only is Ann the Mitt humanizer.', ""My kids joke and say that I'm the Mitt stabilizer."", 'Right.', 'Because whenever Mitt might start, you know, winding up and getting really highly energetic, they know that I have like a very calming influence on him.', 'Well, what do you do?', 'Nothing. Just who I am.', ""In this final stretch, Ann Romney's travel schedule rivals her husband's as she makes the pitch to women voters who hold the key to this election."", ""We count in this country. We're standing up. And our voices need to be heard."", ""It's a role she could not have expected when she met Mitt Romney in 1965 at a high school party."", 'I did fall madly in love with him. Very quickly actually. But I was very aloof, very cool.', ""She was very smart. She set the hook deep. I'd call and say let's get together. She was too busy. She went on a date with someone else while I was pursuing her. Made me just crazy."", 'He was just so much fun. He was a lot of energy. A lot of fun. Captivating. It was just fun, fun, fun to be with him.', 'Romney left for his Mormon mission work in France a year later leaving Ann behind. They kept in touch, but it was hard to be apart. And Ann remembers it to this day.', 'When he left, I had a very brave face, went to the airport with his entire family. We all said good-bye. I was driven home with his family. And then I walked into my home, opened the door - my mother was there, I fell flat on the ground and just dissolved in tears. She could not console me.', ""Ann also has the vivid memory of a middle of the night phone call from George Romney, Mitt's father. Mitt had been in a car crash."", 'I had word that he was killed.', 'Killed?', 'On his passport it is stamped that he is dead. We waited for hours and hours. Most of the night to get word from France that he was actually alive. And so you realize how close your brush with death was. And, again, it just of course has to have an impact on you, which it did for Mitt.', 'Six months later Romney came home. It was Christmas eve 1968.', 'He walked off that airplane and we only had eyes for each other. It was an amazing moment. Those years dissolved and we were right back to where we were exactly when he left.', 'And he proposed.', ""And on the car ride home he's like, oh, my gosh, I've waited so long for you. Let's just get married now. And I'm like why not? Let's do that."", ""Ann was 19, Mitt 21. Their parents wanted them to wait, so they did, one extra month. They were married in Michigan and flew the next day for another ceremony at Salt Lake City's Mormon Temple where they were sealed for eternity as the church calls it. Ann herself was a recent convert to the Mormon church, a process supervised by Mitt's father."", 'This was my own personal decision. It was my own personal conviction. It really was from within.', ""Later on in life Ann's faith and her family would help her meet an unexpected challenge."", 'I really just was having a very, very hard time and was very depressed. And had kind of given up a little bit.', ""It was just before Thanksgiving 1998. Ann Romney's comfortable life as a mother, grandmother and wife of a successful businessman was about to take an unexpected and unhappy turn."", ""She began to see some numbness on her right side. It began spreading, larger and larger. She was having more difficulty getting upstairs. We went to a neurologist. We went into his office and he performed an examination. And it was very clear that she was flunking the examination. She couldn't stand on her right foot without falling over and so forth. And he stepped out. And she began to cry. And I welled up tears as well. We hugged each other. And she said, you know, something is terribly wrong."", 'At age 49, Ann was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, an incurable disease that could shut down the central nervous system.', ""You don't know how much is it going to chew me up and spit me out. Where and when is it going to spit me out? How sick am I going to get? Is this going to be progressive? Am I going to be in a wheelchair? And it's a very, very frightening place to be. And I try to describe to people what the fatigue is like. And I just can't. So the way I try to do it now is to say there is an envelope on the table and someone has to say to me pick up that envelope and open it up and deal with what's inside of it. And it's like, you know, it might be easier for me to go to China than do that."", 'And I know Ann was really distraught and distressed with the diagnosis, particularly as time went on because she was really ill for quite a while.', 'I really just was having a very, very hard time and was very depressed. And had kind of given up a little bit.', 'It was a tough moment for both of them. It was interesting to see the way he treated her as they went through that very caring, very loving, very frustrating for him not to be able to step in and fix it. But it was - they drew even closer.', 'Even when I was as sick as that, he would curl up in the bed with me.', 'Take a minute.', 'So you just knew that that\'s where he was. It was like he was going to do anything he could to just say ""I\'m here, you\'re OK. Just stay right there and we\'ll be OK.""', ""But it isn't always okay. Even more than a decade later. It's a disease that demands constant attention and rest or risk paying the price. (on camera): Now, I know that after super Tuesday, for example, you kind of -"", 'Yes.', 'Had a bit of a relapse.', 'I did.', 'You were running around.', ""I overdid. And I knew I was overdoing. Everyone else has a reserve tank. With M.S., you go to empty and you go to empty and that's it. It's like you can't take another step. You will fall over. And that's kind of what happened to me around the super Tuesday time. And I knew I was pushing my limit. But I also didn't say anything to anyone."", 'Did he notice?', ""No one noticed. Everyone was so busy. And I don't think I was even in the same state. I think, you know, for me I knew I just had to get past that mile mark and I'd be OK and I could rest. But I didn't quite make it to the mile mark. I kind of collapsed before it."", 'I mean literally collapsed.', 'Uh-huh.', 'So I know that the M.S. can be triggered by stress.', 'Right.', ""It's not like you don't have any of that in your life right now. But you deal with it."", 'I deal with it.', ""That happened last March with a long grueling campaign season left to fight. But oddly enough Ann's constant battle with the disease helped her cope with the stress of the campaign."", ""I mean, I'm telling you it is a great teacher. It really is. Because you can't absorb all this that's going on around me. There's a lot of noise and there's a lot of really negative noise that's going on around me and around my husband during this campaign. And so I have to just learn how to not let that just get into my psyche."", 'How do you do that?', ""Well, number one, I know the attacks are not accurate. And they're not true. And so, you know, you just know and have to understand it's part of politics. But really how to have something - it's not an easy thing to learn how to do because I practice it a lot and it doesn't always work. And sometimes things start to sink in. But you have to really have such peace and serenity in your heart. And almost have a Teflon barrier around yourself."", ""It wouldn't be easy because politics is combat. And Ann would soon enlist."", ""There's always days when you just go everyone's a critic. And you just go if you really understood what you're up against when you do run for president, it's a very difficult thing."", ""Ann and Mitt Romney's summer home sits on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire, an oasis for the entire family even in the middle of a campaign."", ""They all just left. A lot of them just left last night. I ran through 12 loads this morning. A lot of towels, a lot of sheets. But it's a joyous. It's a joyous thing to have them all here."", ""tell me a little bit about the Mitt Romney that's here at the lake."", ""Fun loving, warm, spontaneous. Get him out of the public eye, put him in here, he is as loose and funny and spontaneous as you'd ever want to see and just so much fun to be with."", 'So what happens when you get in the public eye?', ""You know, you just have to be more circumspect, you have to be more careful with your words. You just have to be more careful. It's unfortunate that I think than even - you know, people probably only think of Mitt maybe through his business lens. For me, that is just one percent of who he is."", 'But just how to reveal the rest of Romney has been a struggle. After a brutal assault by Democrats painting Romney as an out of touch millionaire.', 'His wife, who has also been criticized as elite, became his chief defender.', ""I've seen him at the Olympics, turning around the Olympic games. I've seen him as a governor, going into a state with a $3 billion budget deficit."", 'A woman who appeals to women.', 'What I hear from women is help, please help.', 'A wife who demystifies her husband.', 'I have a guy standing next to me that has done amazing things in his life.', 'And someone who can carry a dagger wrapped in velvet.', ""And let's be honest. If the last four years had been more successful, do we really think there would be this attack on Mitt Romney's success? Of course not."", ""Ann was a hit at the Republican convention, but her personal testimony wasn't enough to move the needle. Especially after this secret tape recording of Romney at a private fund-raiser became public."", 'There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government. So my job is not to worry about those people.', 'That tape only played to the stereotype. (on camera): A significant majority of people do not believe he understands their problems. And when he talked about the 47 percent, that only seemed to compound that problem.', ""That's not an accurate perception that he's obviously running for 100 percent of the Americans, that there are many people need Mitt's help right now and that I think, you know, for folks to understand that this is a guy who does care, who does understand. That's why we're running. He's not a person that talks. He's a person that goes and does."", 'The tape set off alarm bells for a candidate already in trouble, anxious Republicans started second-guessing the campaign. So Ann went off script. (on camera): You said, stop it. This is hard. You want the to try it? Get in the ring. You seemed really upset by that.', ""Well, there's always days when you just go, you know, everyone is a critic and you just go, if you really understood what you're up against when you do run for president, it's a very difficult thing."", 'Especially when the candidate has trouble connecting with voters. Romney needed a game-changer and the first debate was his chance. Ann Romney sat down with us just days before the big event. (on camera): Is there one thing he needs to do to break through?', ""You know, I would love it, personally, just for people to tune in and just watch. Because, you know, there's been so many other opinions and commentary and everything else, let's just see him, let's just see who he is, let's just see how he thinks, let's just see what he feels. For me, that's the important thing that must come through."", ""It's not easy for Romney to do that so he follows a few debate routines."", 'As soon as he gets on stage, the first thing he does is he takes off his watch and puts it on the podium. But then he writes ""dad"" on a piece of paper. And that\'s amazing because he loves his dad, respects his dad, doesn\'t want to do anything that would not make his father proud. Then he looks in the audience, and he finds me. He has to find where I am. He needs just that connection. And almost after every answer that he gives, he\'ll find me in the audience to see, was that good? Was that OK?', 'What do you do?', 'Good. Good.', ""What if you don't like what he did?"", ""I don't do any of that."", ""So even on stage, you're -"", 'Yes, even on stage there is an emotional connection that is happening between the two of us during the debate itself.', 'Romney pulled off an impressive performance, breathing new life into the campaign.', ""You've been president for four years. You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's now four years later, we still have trillion-dollar deficits."", 'I was so thrilled at the debate, for people to see my husband unfiltered through - without any negative ads.', 'Throughout the debates, Romney, the pragmatist was on stage, not Romney, the conservative of the Republican primaries, confusing to some but not to Ann, who finally saw the side of Romney she had been pushing to reveal all along.', ""As you know, Gloria, I said last time I would never do this again. I mean, it's really hard for a family member, a person that loves this person that you see going through these difficulties and just know how tough it is on that person that you love, and so for me it comes out of a compassion for Mitt and a compassion and a passion for how important this election is.

Now to one of my favorite stories of the day that illicits really strong feelings. It\'s a kind of a social media spat that involves the sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Now, take a look at this, here\'s a tweet from Randi Zuckerberg, that\'s his sister, and it says this, ""digital etiquette, always ask permission before posting a friend\'s photo publicly. It\'s not about privacy settings, it\'s about human decency."" Well, that was in response to the release of a family photo that Zuckerberg -- she posted it to Facebook. She thought only her friends could see it, but you guessed it, her privacy settings weren\'t quite right, so someone who wasn\'t supposed to see it did and then they shared it. I mean, the photo doesn\'t really reveal anything. But here\'s what may have happened, when you upload a photo to Facebook you pick the privacy settings. But even when you select only friends Facebook includes friends of friends of anyone who is tagged in that picture. Now if that\'s not what you want, then you have to select custom instead. Got that? From there, you can un-include friends of anyone tagged. But you have to remember to take that extra step. By the way, Randi Zuckerberg is a former Facebook director. Now, you could also do this for 2013, you could shut down your Facebook and go out and find a real friend and cultivate that friendship throughout the year. Get off the computer. Before we go, I want to show you some incredible pictures -- I do like photography -- surveillance cameras caught this moment. It\'s an aquarium full of sharks, turtles and fish and it burst in the middle of a shopping mall in Shanghai, China. Surprise, surprise. I\'ll have the fish. It sent the glass -- it sent creatures flying into the crowd, water even sweeping away a man standing in front of the tank. Chinese state media reports 16 people were injured.

CNN-199346,THE SITUATION ROOM,2013-1-14,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1301/14/sitroom.03.html,,President Obama Talks Debt Ceiling,"[""Happening now: Lance Armstrong apologizes ahead of an expected confession. President Obama gets combative with Congress over the debt ceiling. The U.S. and European allies take action against terrorists in Northern Africa. High demand, but short supplies of the flu vaccine. Plus, a preview and a look at the preparations for Inauguration Day. Wolf Blitzer is off. I'm Joe Johns. You are in THE SITUATION ROOM. . We are waiting for any news coming out of one of the biggest sports interviews in recent memory. Today, disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong sat down with Oprah Winfrey. Right before that interview, Armstrong made a personal and tearful apology to the staff of the cancer charity he founded about the doping that led him to being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. CNN's Ed Lavandera is working the story for us in Dallas. Ed, what's the latest you are hearing there?"", ""Hey, Joe. Around lunchtime today, Lance Armstrong showed up at the headquarters of the LIVESTRONG Foundation, which is also in Austin, and met with the staff. I am told the meeting lasted about 15 to 20 minutes and it was tearful on Lance Armstrong's part. He apologized to the staff for the stress that he has caused them over the years and he also urged them to continue fighting for those suffering from cancer. But he did not talk or admit to steroid use in the meeting this afternoon."", ""It's a script that would make a Hollywood writer jealous. Cycling athlete gets cancer, nearly dies, but heroically comes back to win the world's most famous race, not once, not twice, but a record-breaking seven straight times. Oh, and, by the way, he also starts a cancer foundation which has raised $470 million, and has provided inspiration to millions around the world. But a dark cloud hovering over this story never blew past. Suspicions that grew into allegations that Lance Armstrong used performance- enhancing drugs to accomplish his incredible feats. The suspicions were confirmed in October when the United States Anti- Doping Agency released thousand of pages of evidence of what it said was a sophisticated doping program. Armstrong was stripped of his Tour de France titles and banned from all Olympic sports for life. One by one, his sponsors have left him too. Late last year, Armstrong was forced out from LIVESTRONG, the cancer charity he founded. Armstrong has kept a low profile at his Austin home since the report was released. But Armstrong's repeated denials other the years to protect his name have angered many."", ""I have said it for seven years. I have said it for longer than seven years. I have never doped. I can say it again. But I have said it for seven years. It doesn't help."", 'Former teammates found guilty of doping themselves went on record.', 'Did you see Lance Armstrong using other performance enhance drugs?', 'At times, yes, different training camps.', 'He took what we all took. Really no difference between Lance Armstrong and I would say the majority of the peloton, you know?', ""Repercussions. So why is he doing this now? One reason could be hope a confession might give him a shot at resuming his competitive triathlon career, for which he is banned for life. At age 41, he doesn't have much time left to make a clean start in another sport."", ""Joe, the question will become to what extent will Lance Armstrong confess? What will he talk about in this interview. It's expected to air on Thursday night. But he is not out of the woods yet. There are still other sponsors that want money paid back and some other legal issues that he is facing. So, this is a very delicate situation for Lance Armstrong as he enters into this interview -- Joe."", 'Ed Lavandera, thanks for that. We will have more on the huge legal implications for Lance Armstrong, including what could happen if he is found to have lied in a sworn deposition.', ""Coming at 6:30, that is. There is a lot to talk about on that. A lot of questions I have, that's for sure. Another big story we are watching, the coming battle over the debt ceiling. Both sides in the debt ceiling battle speaking out today, but neither side is blinking in the high-stakes game of chicken that could take the country to a financial brink. CNN's White House correspondent, Brianna Keilar, has the latest on this. Brianna, it sure sounded today that the president was ready for a fight over the debt ceiling."", ""He reiterated that he will not negotiate with House Republicans on the debt ceiling, the end, period. That's what he said. He said Congress has a responsibility to increase the debt ceiling and to use it as a bargaining chip is absurd."", ""Tough talk from the bully pulpit to send a message to Republicans that they can't take the U.S. economy to the brink of default."", ""Republicans in Congress have two choices here. They can act responsibly, and pay America's bills, or they can act irresponsibly and put America through another economic crisis. But they will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy."", 'Republicans are insisting the debt ceiling, expected to become necessary in late February, is tied to spending cuts. The president gave in on that demand in the bruising debt ceiling battle of 2011. Not again, says President Obama.', ""The difference between this year and 2011 is the fact that we've already made $1.2 trillion in cuts. And at -- at the time, I indicated that there were cuts that we could sensibly make that would not damage our economy, would not impede growth."", 'In a statement, Speaker John Boehner stood by House Republican efforts to use the debt ceiling as leverage. ""The American people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing spending at the same time,"" he said. ""The consequences of failing to increase the debt ceiling are real, but so too are the consequences of allowing our spending problem to go unresolved.""', 'If you think about my first four years...', ""President Obama addressed concern that his new Cabinet lacks diversity. Of Obama's 16 Cabinet positions, only two are women. Recent appointments to top Cabinet posts have all been white men. But the president promised the diversity of his second-term Cabinet will meet that of his first."", 'But I would just suggest that everybody wait until they have seen all my appointments, who is in the White House staff and who is in my Cabinet before they rush to judgment.', 'The president also responded to criticism that he has not spent enough time building relationships across the aisle, dismissing the notion.', ""With respect to the -- this truism about me not socializing enough, and patting folks on the back and all that stuff, most people who know me know I -- I'm a pretty friendly guy. And I like a good party."", ""Well, that sure got a Chuckle, but President Obama said that socializing is important and that he can do a better job. But he downplayed the suggestion that his reputation as not being the chummiest of presidents has gotten in the way of his brokering deals with Congress. In fact, Kate, he said he played golf with John Boehner and had a good time, but that doesn't result in a deal in 2011."", ""No, it sure didn't."", ""Another big topic at today's press conference was the issue of gun control. What did the president say when he was asked about that and the task force that he has asked to give him recommendations?"", 'This was interesting, Kate, because it turns out he already has the recommendations from Vice President Biden. We were expecting those to come tomorrow. He said he already has them, he is reviewing them. He was going to meet one on one with the vice president to discuss them. And he said later this week he would be rolling out his proposals. So, certainly, we will wait for that. But another thing he was asked about -- and this comes amid signals that perhaps the White House is not going to pursue an assault weapons ban as aggressively as certainly some gun control advocates had hoped. He was asked about that and sort of sidestepped whether that would part of his recommendations. I guess we will have to see.', 'Yes, we are waiting to see what those recommendations are as the week continues. Brianna Keilar at the White House, thanks, Brianna.', ""Forty-seven states are now reporting widespread flu activity, including New York, where a public health state of emergency is now in effect. And for people who waited until now to get a flu shot, finding a vaccine suddenly has gotten a lot harder. CNN's Mary Snow is working on the story for us. Mary, what are you seeing?"", ""Well, Joe, the CDC is reporting spot shortages in some areas of the country. One area is New York. That's because of a surge in demand after that public health emergency you just mentioned was issued over the weekend. The order gives pharmacies more latitude in being able to administer shots, but it also means there are some pharmacies now short on supply."", ""This pharmacy in Brooklyn has a sign telling people they give flu shots. But, inside, the best pharmacist Bassam Amin could do was put people like David O'Keefe on a waiting list."", ""Hopefully, we'll have flu shots for you tomorrow."", 'OK.', 'I have 80 shots coming in.', 'OK.', 'Your number will be 76.', ""Amin ran out of vaccine on Sunday after New York's governor declared a public health emergency over the weekend. The declaration gives pharmacist the ability to give children flu shots. In New York, they ordinarily can only give vaccines to people 18 and older. (on camera): What was this weekend like?"", 'It was chaotic. A lot of people come in, in panic. They want to get the whole family immunized.', ""And it wasn't much different at bigger chains like Walgreens."", ""It's been a little bit insane, to be honest. As soon as the public emergency was declared, it was like the floodgates opened and everyone wanted their flu shot and they were coming in just in hordes looking to get it."", 'This Walgreens replenished its supply of vaccines this morning. Other chains like CVS also reported shortages at some of its locations. And while there may be a shortage of flu vaccine in some places, there is no shortage of New Yorkers taking to social media to write about their experiences, like this tweet: ""This flu is brutal. Not hungry, whole body aches like crazy, throat kills."" Some folks are capitalizing on disgruntled New Yorkers expressing themselves through social media. One app developer is tracking the flu in six cities including New York.', 'We download publicly available tweets, and then we put them through our machine learning system that decides', 'And New York is just one of six cities that app is currently monitoring. As are the vaccine, manufacturers have told us there are still many doses to be shipped out. If you are having trouble finding them where you live, there are many Web sites that may help you find it in your area. One set up by the government, Flu.gov, is a good place to start -- Joe.', 'I will take that one, Mary. Mary Snow in New York, thanks so much, Mary.', 'Sure.', ""Still ahead, did Lance Armstrong commit perjury when he denied doping under oath?

I am live in Washington, D.C., with very special coverage of President Barack Obama's inauguration. Thank you so much for joining us on this historic weekend. Worship was a key part of the day for the first family today. President and Mrs. Obama attended services with their daughters at the metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal church. They celebrated slain civil rights leader, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. at one of the most historic churches in Washington. And tomorrow is of course, the main event. Some 800,000 people expected to pack the west front of the capitol to watch President Obama publicly take his oath of office. The president has already started his second term.

But, let's get to what is happening in right now in Washington with final inaugural preparations are under way. Senior congressional correspondent Dana Bash is here with me. And Dana, you talked with the chair of the inaugural committee, Senator Charles Schumer. What is he saying today?"", ""You know, it is very interesting. I was obviously -- that's building that I'm very familiar with, I cover that building. I walk -- hi, everybody."", 'Hello.', ""I walk the halls of that building in, you know, every single day. And to see the transformation as it happened was remarkable. People may not realize that it's the chair and ranking member of what's called the Senate rules committee that are really in charge of making this happen. And I talked to the chair, who is Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. Here's a little bit of what he told me about how the preparation has gone on."", 'All right.', ""You know, it started close to a year ago, we didn't know hot president would be. But together, it is always done in a bipartisan way. Lamar Alexander and I and the chair of the rules committee. He is in charge and he is the vice chair and we do things as much as together as we can. You have to build a platform, 1600 people. There are among the most coveted seats in America, anytime, anywhere. The number of calls you get sit on the platform."", ""I can't imagine."", 'Just huge.', ""And you just saw the building of that platform. I will give you some fun facts. It took 3 1/2 months to build, 10,000 square feet that's how big it is, 22,000 pieces of plywood. And some other inaugural fun facts, 30,000 chairs are on the west front grounds are."", 'Wow.', 'Twenty three miles of cabling for what we do up there which is broadcast.

And all of those beautiful structures and they were temporary. It took them years in times it built. And after, it all came down.', ""It is true. But this is really the west front, what they built there is that they have been doing it since Ronald Reagan was the first to move it from the east frowned front to the west front, they have it -- sort of have it down to the science now. But, I tell you, it actually that is where I walked in. It is beautiful. Isn't it fabulous?"", 'Yes.', ""That is where I usually walk into the office and I haven't been able to do that for the past 3 1/2 months. It would be nice to get it back."", ""Now you're just bragging."", 'No. Come visit us any time.', ""It's always good to see you, Dana."", 'Thanks, Don.', ""Let's hang before I leave. If we have a minute. Thank you, Dana Bash. You know, much like Super Bowl weekend, there's something for everyone when it comes to the festivities during the inauguration weekend. At the top of the next hour, actress Eva Longoria hosts a salute to the president called Latino inaugural 2013 in performance to the Kennedy Center. Following that the red, white and blue ball and let freedom ring concert and there was even a hip-hop ball. Rapper two chains, R&B; stars Brandy and John legend and some of the many artists who are making their appearances there. Then at 8:00 p.m., the president and vice president will attend a candlelight reception at the national building museum. So make sure you stay tuned for that. CNN is going to cover that for you. Now, let's talk more about the red, white and blue ball it kicks off at the Warner Theater in Washington next hour. The party is in honor of our nation's soldiers and lots of military families are expected to be there. Our Brooke Baldwin is there, too. Brooke, Washington is in party mode this weekend. What's the mood like there at the Warner center?"", ""Hey, Don. Good to talk to you. Yes, the mood, not quite festive yet. We are still a little early. Doesn't kick off for another couple hours. But, we are standing in front of the Warner Theater. As you point out, I got my red on, the Heroes red, white and blue ball. Inside, this whole thing is put on by this group called citizens helping heroes or CHH. These guys got together in 2003, military veterans, one is Republican, on is democrat and in perfect D.C. fashion, you know, in a bipartisan way. They said they wanted to come together and help our men and women in uniform. So tonight, let's talk about the party. We will have Republicans. We will have Democrats. I'm talking house speaker John Boehner. We will have Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi. We will have Congressman Kevin McCarthy. We will have Senator Carl Levin. On both sides of the aisle, they will be here honoring folks who will be coming who have been handpicked with the help of the DOD and folks at the Pentagon, wounded warriors. Actually I was just talking to one of the organizers tonight, Don. She told me one of the widows from SEAL team six will be here tonight. So we will try to talk to her. And a couple of awards will be handed out. Just quickly, we learned a number of the Tuskegee airmen will be near attendance and perhaps, perhaps, the big headliner, is Lynyrd Skynyrd, you know, good old southern rock guys. They will be here presenting and introducing some of these Tuskegee airmen. So, look out for that. We will be here. We will bring you the party live from the Warner Theater, the red, white and blue ball. Don Lemon, you jealous?"", ""All right. Oh, yes, of course I am. But you should be jealous because I'm going to the hip-hop ball as well. So, you have got your party shoes on, you are appropriately dressed. So, I got my dance shoes on, I'm going to be ready, we will be at dueling balls."", 'Awesome.', 'Brooke Baldwin. Thank you, Brooke. I will see you later. And you know, I have been doing my share of partying in Washington, too. Brooke has as well. And these are pictures, take a look at our CNN team at the ""Washington Post"" ball last night. I call them Don\'s angels. And a special delivery, the Bible, once used by the late Dr. Martin Luther King, flown from Atlanta to D.C., hand delivered for tomorrow\'s ceremony. Just how significant are the Bibles used during inauguration ceremonies? And a story that weighs in. Plus, predicting that the president\'s second-term policies will fail.

John Quincy Adams on a book of laws?', ""That's right. Franklin Pierce also on a book of law. Partly we think because he lost his last child only a couple of months before the inauguration. His wife was in bereavement and he affirmed the oath rather than swore to it which the Constitution. The next was Theodore Roosevelt. So, there is a long time and that's because he took office after the death of the president and he was in a hotel in buffalo and apparently, they didn't have Gideon's' Bibles around. He was the next one. And so, you look at those, three the last is LBJ, who, of course, after another assassination, they had a catholic missile that he took the oath on. So, constant scattered throughout American history."", 'Have president invoked religion in their addresses, always?', 'Every president has invoked god or a deity in general, but not very specifically. None has actually mentioned Jesus Christ, four have invoked Christianity. So, it s also be uneven.', 'Has religion become more or less important over time in inaugural addresses?', ""Yes. Looking into the subject, I'm surprise so surprised to see the turning point came with FDR. He was the first to have a prayer in the inauguration. He was the first to have an invocation and a benediction. He was the first to go to church on inauguration day. And so, those things that have become tradition now were only as old as the 1930s and '40s."", ""The significance of using, of President Obama using you Dr. King's Bible, I mean, that cannot be downplayed."", ""Well, you know, we know that Obama has seen himself as a part of that tradition with Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King. You think of Dr. King's phrase about, the moral arc of the universe is long but it dips toward justice. And I think President Obama is trying to be part of that arc."", ""That's -- thank you very much. Good stuff, Ed Ayers. As I said to you yesterday, I could sit here around talk to you all day. Thank you.

President Obama taking part in a few more of the inaugural traditions, the celebrations, before getting down to business for the second term. The President is attending -- right now you see it there, it is glorious, a prayer service at the National Cathedral in Washington. I want to bring in our White House correspondent, Dan Lothian. Dan, you know, this is a tradition that goes back to George Washington. Obviously, it's evolved. Gorgeous, gorgeous voice of that singer there. Tell us what the family is doing, the first family, and how they are responding after they -- a big, big day of celebrations and the inauguration."", ""Well, that's right. And, you know, this is tradition on the day after inauguration, the swearing-in, all the pomp and circumstance, to head to church here at the National Cathedral. And the President, the First Lady, the Vice President and Ms. Biden, seated in the front -- or seated in the front row, other members of the President's Cabinet also here. Attorney General Eric holder is here. HHS Secretary Sebelius as well, several others. It has been a mix of Bible readings and other spiritual readings as well as choirs singing here. Just wrapped up the sermon with the Reverend Adam Hamilton, a senior pastor of the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Kansas. And one interesting point: he talked about the partisanship here in Washington and the need for the President and lawmakers to find one or two things, as he called them, dreams or visions, where they can find agreement in order to move this country forward. And so even here in church, the realization that there's been a lot of partisanship here in Washington and that, in order to move forward, lawmakers have to work together. As he pointed out, those on both sides of the aisle need to find these areas of agreement. As you pointed out, this is a rich tradition of coming here the day after inauguration, dating back to 1933 was the first time that it happened here at this location, FDR at the beginning of his inauguration. So continues -- the only person who hasn't been here, you know who it is?"", 'No. Tell me.', 'President Bill Clinton, former president Bill Clinton. Yes, he attended an historically African-American church here in Washington, D.C., for both of his services, Suzanne.', ""I'm not good with the trivia there, Dan. I want to talk a little bit about the President's agenda, because, obviously, very ambitious when we heard his inaugural speech. And today you've got folks who are fighting back, hitting back, saying, look, you know what? We're going to draw the line in the sand here. We have disagreements and they're going to talk to the President about that. Here's what some of the Senate leaders said."", ""Democrats will hold fast to the guiding principle that a strong middle class an opportunity for every American to enter the middle class is the key to the nation's success. Democrats will stand strong, strong for that standard of balance will remain resolute in pursuit of fairness for all Americans."", ""We should start with spending and debt because, if we don't get a handle on that, nothing else matters. If we don't work together to strengthen our entitlement programs, they will go bankrupt. Automatic cuts will be forced on seniors already receiving benefits, rendering worthless the promises that they built their retirements around."", ""So, Dan, it certainly looks like they are not in the mood for compromise. It certainly looks like there's a fight on their hands regarding debt and spending and the budget here. How does the President -- does he have a different kind of approach moving forward in the second administration?"", ""Well, I think so. I mean, what you will see from the President is reaching out to the public to get them engaged. You've heard the White House talk about this, the President wants to use pressure from the outside to apply pressure on members of Congress to push his agenda forward. In addition we've seen how the President's grassroots campaign operation has been brought back to life to sort of fuel this public pressure from the outside. And then one other point we have heard, that the First Lady also will play a bigger role in pushing the President's agenda forward in this second term. So, I think all of that, applying pressure from the outside, will be a strategy that we'll see from the President as he tries to get some of these tough things through Congress when it comes to immigration reform or gun policies that the President has been putting together."", ""All right. Dan, thanks. I know it's really, really frigidly cold there, so we're going to let you go. Thanks. Appreciate it."", 'Yes.', 'Gun rights to gun control, immigration, environment, President Obama charting an ambition course for the next four years in office. Addressing the issues laid out in the inaugural speech, of course, a tall order and joining us to talk about all of this, the agenda, the road ahead, CNN contributor, former White House official Van Jones, along with our CNN contributor, Republican strategist Ana Navarro. Both of you guys, it was fantastic. This weekend was just chock-full of -- I know you went to a couple of balls, a lot of events taking place. But you know, ceremonial stuff aside, serious work to be done. Van, I know you, being the climate change guy, very important to you. You must have been jumping up and down when you heard the President talk about this. Watch.', 'We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.', ""So, Van, you've been talking about this for years and it sounds like, you know, the President is now making it a priority in his second term. What's the most important thing he's going to have to do, especially, addressing climate change?"", ""Well, first of all, I think Hurricane Sandy, that superstorm, the way that it really hit New York. It hit New Jersey. I think that put it back on the map. You know, it really wasn't talked about by either candidate in this last round, but I was totally thrilled. And, not just that, but he spoke to every stripe in his rainbow coalition, an historic statement with regard to lesbians and gays, including them, women, people of color, the entire, new emerging majority. But all of that I think is in jeopardy if we don't do anything about climate change. He can do a lot of things with executive orders. The existing coal plants could be made more clean with executive authority. And, also, he should do a bilateral with the leadership of China. China right now is having a horrible environmental crisis. The air quality's going down. There's an opportunity for both these superpowers to sit down together. But the President's unleashed. He's unchained. He's willing to go out there and speak from his heart. You're going to see a very different second term."", 'All right, Ana is never -- you\'re always unleashed and unchained, Ana. You are never a wallflower about any of these things. Talk about the tone here because some of your fellow Republicans not happy about it. They didn\'t really think it was genuine in terms of reaching across the aisle. This is from the conservative group, Americans for Prosperity. They called it, quote, ""a harshly ideological aggressively partisan speech, more appropriate for the campaign trail than for the solemn occasion of his inaugural ceremony."" How did it come across to you?', ""It came across that way. You know, I was with him at the beginning. He was talking about the Constitution, about all men being created equal, about togetherness, but then came this entire section which was about some of the most divisive and controversial issues that we face as a country today. I think Van is right. He did speak to every stripe of his rainbow coalition. The problem is he didn't peek to the folks that didn't vote for him. And I think an inaugural address is a unique opportunity to do that, to unite the country, to present a united vision, to invite the other people who didn't vote for you to work with you and I think Republicans didn't hear that from him. What we heard was a very defiant tone. What we heard was a President Obama saying, I'm not inviting you to work with me. I'm going to make you do these things. And, look, Suzanne, I am a pro-gay rights, pro- immigration reform Republican who believes in climate change and I found it a divisive speech, so I can only imagine what al of those Americans who don't share those beliefs heard when they heard that speech."", ""Well, Van, I want to ask you this question because, you know, the President really called to people to action, to task here. Really saying, look, you know, we have to actively get involved to help him carry out his agenda. But Valerie Jarrett, one of his top advisers -- got a chance to catch up with her this weekend -- she said this is really important because you can't get it done without really kind of the grassroots, the people that he won over the first go-round. And here's how she put it."", ""He made it very clear at the end of his first term that immigration reform is a top priority. We're now beginning to see glimmers of hope that the Republicans might be willing to engage with us on that. We have to create jobs and that means investing in manufacturing, new clean energy, infrastructure, all of that is important, education. And as he and the Vice President announced last week, reducing gun violence, particularly for our children, is a priority. And, so, all of the legislation to do that will be going up to Congress, but we also need the American people involved in that. Everyone has a responsibility. Everyone has a role to play on everything on his agenda. So, it is a robust agenda. It's an ambitious agenda. But our country can do great things, big things."", ""So, Van, I'm curious here because, you know, the last go- round when he won, everybody was excited. They had a registry, information of all these people and then it seemed like they kind of dropped the ball. Like, you know, it was over. The campaign was over and all of these people like faded away in the distance. How do you get people engaged? How do you get them to stick around and say, OK, we're engaged. We want to figure out how to move the ball forward and get some of these policies in place?"", ""Well, a couple of things. I think the President's calling for both a new movement and a new patriotism. On the movement side, you already see this new entity called Organizing for Action. The campaign that everybody -- it stunned everybody. People thought, oh, it's going to be very close. It wasn't close. Why? There was an apparatus out there that had been built that was strong and was able to deliver. That apparatus is now being turned over and unleashed to move his agenda forward. That's going to be a game changer for people who are used to things only happening in D.C. The Heartland will have a say. But more importantly, to some of Ana's points, he was answering Reagan. Obama is in a conversation that's been going on in our country for a very long time. If you look at Reagan's second inaugural, it was also defiant. It was also talking about his principles, but he rooted those principles in deep American values. The President did that. I think he spoke to his base, but he spoke in terms that were resonant with the best principles of the country. It's a new patriotism, not just a liberty-only patriotism, which we're hearing from Paul Ryans, but a liberty and justice for all, more inclusive, I think, more holistic."", ""All right, Ana, we're going to have you -- I want you to weigh in and then we're going to fast forward 2016, right? You and I were talking about this. We were both at the Kennedy Center at the Latino celebration. And Vice President Biden, I mean, he really made an impression. What makes you think he's trying to vie for the Latino votes?"", ""Well, first of all, I know Joe Biden and I think he's on campaign-mode already. You know, we saw a Joe Biden sprinting through the parade route yesterday. I think he was trying to show us he's a very spry, fit, 70-year-old who will be in very good shape in four years. He became the first vice president to get sworn in by a Latina justice, Justice Sotomayor. He showed up to the Latino ball, first vice president to do that. So, I think it's just a matter of time before we hear Joe Biden singing or -- in Spanish or reciting Irish poetry in Spanish because I think Joe Biden is a very smart politician, he realizes how important the Latino vote was to this victory and I think he's prepping himself for a 2016 run. Look, he said it at that Latino ball that the head of this new Futuro PAC, which is a Hispanic Democrat Super PAC that has been founded that includes Eva Longoria and some others, said those people have been over his house so many times in the last three days that they were probably tired of seeing him. Well, I don't think that's by coincidence."", ""Yeah. No. So, give us a break. We want one day where we're going to just take a break from all this and then we'll start and we'll start covering 2016. Ana, Van, good to see you both."", ""Are you kidding? We've been in 2016 mode now for two months, Suzanne."", ""All right, we just can't catch a break."", ""Biden's sincere about it, though. He's sincere."", 'All right, good to see you guys. They have dozens of political parties vying for the votes. Israelis heading to the polls. Why Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems set to return. Bigger question is what kind of government is he going to be leading?']","['MALVEAUX', 'DAN LOTHIAN, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT', 'MALVEAUX', 'LOTHIAN', 'MALVEAUX', 'SEN.

There is a Mexican drug lord in Chicago. He is now public enemy number one. In fact, the head of the DEA in Chicago is saying now that this guy is worse than Capone. He is this guy, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. He is the man the U.S. Treasury Department calls the most influential drug trafficker in the world. Ted Rowlands is joining us from Chicago. And, Ted, you know, Chicago, 1,500 miles from Mexico, but this guy now public enemy number one, why?', ""Well, because he is head of the Sinaloa drug cartel, Suzanne, and their impact on the streets of Chicago over the last five years, according to the DEA, has increased immeasurably. They are selling methamphetamines, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana on the streets here. Chicago is being used as a distribution hub for the entire Midwest. They say that his influence and his cartel's influence is having an adverse effect, to say the least, on the streets here in Chicago. And that that's the reason that he really is, if you're going to pinpoint it, who is causing the most trouble, he's the guy, even though he doesn't live anywhere close to Chicago."", ""Ted, do we think they're anywhere close to even finding this guy and to capturing him and bringing him to justice?"", ""Well, he lives, apparently, up on top of a mountain in Mexico and basically directs everything from there, so is -- are they going to go after him or does this change the attempt to get him? Absolutely not. It's more symbolic basically. What they're trying to do is wake people up and say, listen, there's a huge gun violence problem in the city of Chicago. Well, a major component of that is drugs, and a major supplier of those drugs is this guy in Mexico."", ""And, Ted, we don't need to even tell our viewers about the problems that Chicago has been facing when it comes to violence. We've been covering it almost every day now. And the president, he's going to be showing up in Chicago in about three hours or so, not just to talk about the economy, the State of the Union and all that, but certainly the violence that is in his home city. And one of the things that he made a point in the Sate of the Union address is saying, look, you know what, this is something that is not acceptable anymore. I want to remind our viewers how he put it in terms of his mission."", 'Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence, they deserve a simple vote.', ""So, Ted, we saw in that video, of course, State of the Union, the parents of Hadiya Pendleton who was gunned down in Chicago. This was just a week after she participated in the president's inauguration. How are folks -- how are they talking about this? I mean, the president is going to come. He's going to talk a little bit about this. Do they think it's going to be useful at all?"", ""I think a lot of people want the president's visit to basically extend the conversation that started with Hadiya's death. It really struck a nerve this city and they're hoping that the president will continue that momentum of people doing what they can on a personal level, whether it's policing your own family or your own block or helping to get laws passed to extend the punishment for gun laws in this city. They're hoping that the president will help continue this dialogue because there's a real sense here that we're at a fork in the road and there's an opportunity for real change."", ""All right, Ted, thank you. Really appreciate it. Again, the president's going to visit Chicago this afternoon to talk about the gun violence. It is really extraordinary when you look at what is happening in that city. We're going to bring that to you live. That is 3:00 p.m. Eastern. And, also, you know, journalists, we cover these stories, but sometimes we are also a part of it. We are directly impacted by it, and the violence in Chicago has a very personal connection to a member of my team, our e.p., executive producer Tanisha Bell. She grew up on the South Side of Chicago. When she was just five, a five-year-old girl, her father was murdered, happened less than two miles from where Michelle Obama grew up. Well, she has written her own personal account of growing up without her dad and then losing other close friends to gun violence. I want you to check it out. It is a beautiful piece.

She didn\'t see anything, but what she heard when she was on the phone with Trayvon Martin was George Zimmerman following Trayvon Martin, pursuing Trayvon Martin and approaching Trayvon Martin. She says then Trayvon Martin as George Zimmerman got close to him said ""why are you following me?"" In response, George Zimmerman said one of two things, he either said, ""what are you doing around here?"" or ""what are you talking about?"" Either way she places George Zimmerman as the pursuer and as you know, Chris, self-defense requires that you don\'t be the first aggressor. If George Zimmerman was the first aggressor, was the person to pursue and approach Trayvon Martin, in my view, self-defense is off the table for this defense.', 'But legally is it off the table or is the burden just higher?', ""Well, the prosecution of course has the burden of proof in this case beyond a reasonable doubt and also has the burden to rebut self defense. But let's talk about practically you have six women that are jurors. They were watching Rachel Jeantel intently. I was in the courtroom for a lot of her testimony and I got to tell you, I think practically, if these jurors believe her and they believe that George Zimmerman started this fight, I just can't imagine that they'll believe that he shot in self-defense."", ""Sunny, how hurtful was it for Rachel Jeantel to admit on the stand she didn't know whether or not it was Trayvon Martin who was the one who was beating up Zimmerman at that time? Those are her words. What do you think they'll mean?"", ""I'm not sure what they'll mean, Chris, but again, we saw a very different Rachel Jeantel on the witness stand, yes, from the first day, she was so very combative. She seemed to be very uncomfortable on the witness stand. We saw a different person yesterday. She was comfortable, she was confident and she was firm, although, yes, the defense did I think a pretty good job at cross- examining her, finding some inconsistencies. She wasn't inconsistent when it came to her view that George Zimmerman was the one that approached and followed Trayvon Martin."", 'Right, but approaching and following is different than starting the fight, and she did say, ""I don\'t know whether or not it was Trayvon beating him up"" so interesting for the jury. One other thing before we let you go, Sunny, race. Up until this point in the trial had been about, well, all Zimmerman sees is black people in his neighborhood and it seems to make him crazy, so obviously that\'s the best case for the prosecution to say in his mind he had evil thoughts about his people as he set off that night against Trayvon Martin. But yesterday the defense counsel made race an issue for Trayvon Martin and kept using the words, the insensitive words about white people. Do you think that had an impact that Trayvon Martin was using that language? Does that change anything?', ""You know, it was interesting that the defense tried so very hard at the beginning of this case to keep race out because they didn't want the prosecution to talk about racial profiling and they won that victory, right, the prosecution was only able in opening statement to say profiling. However, yes, the defense seemed to take what was the elephant in the room, put it right in front of the courtroom, paint it bright pink, talk so much about race and put it on Trayvon Martin but these were Trayvon Martin's words. He said some very derogatory terms describing George Zimmerman. But I don't know. I think it sort of made Rachel's testimony a bit more credible. She didn't try to sugar coat what Trayvon told her. She also said he not only used this derogatory term about white people, he also called George Zimmerman the N-word, in her word the description wasn't a racial term. It was a descriptive term."", 'Right.', ""You may or may not agree with that, but again I don't know that the defense scored so many points by trying to make Trayvon Martin out to be a racist. It did make a lot of sense in the courtroom."", 'Because at the end of the day, Trayvon Martin not on trial here. He is the victim. Sunny Hostin, thank you very much. Appreciate the analysis.', 'Exactly.', 'Kate?', 'Thanks, Chris. There is a lot of news developing at this hour, straight to Michaela for the list.', 'Good morning, Kate. Good morning, Chris. And good morning to you at home. Making news at this hour. Police back at the home of former New England Patriot, now murder suspect Aaron Hernandez.

CNN-223086,LEGAL VIEW WITH ASHLEIGH BANFIELD,2014-1-16,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1401/16/lvab.02.html,,"Coach Sues Boy in Little League Baseball; Michelle Obama, Barack Obama Speech","[""Keeping a live eye on the microphone. You can see a picture of Michelle Obama. This is summit held on students being able to attend college. A young man, by all accounts, shouldn't have made it through high school and didn't. Because of a number of programs, he's currently a full ride scholarship student sophomore at bard which is terrific. We're going to watch that. He'll introduce the first lady. The first lady will introduce the president. We'll get you to that live when it starts. This is a weird story. A little league baseball coach has decided he's going to sue a former 14-year-old player, 14. He's suing him for $600,000 because of the way the 14-year-old celebrated a home run. John Berman looks at the parent's reaction and what the coach wants out of this lawsuit."", ""California parents are in disbelief this morning after their 14-year-old was sued by his little league coach. The offense? Throwing his helmet after the home run, hitting the coach's ankle and allegedly tearing his Achilles tendon."", 'It thought it was a joke. How can this be a grown man suing a young boy.', 'It was almost laughable.', ""It wasn't laughable for the coach, Alan Beck, a chiropractor who is seeking $500,000 in pain and suffering and $100,000 in lost wages."", ""When a 6 foot 14-year-old with a large helmet hits somebody's Achilles and split it, you should be apologetic for it."", 'Allegedly, it hit here somewhere.', ""The boy's parents are calling foul, saying they didn't receive information about the lawsuit until six months after the alleged injury took place."", 'I spoke with little league, several board members. They were just, what?', 'Beck coach claims the family knew about his injury and turned their backs on him when he reached out for help.', ""It's not about the money with this family. It's about the acknowledgment and taking responsibility for their action."", 'Some say the lawsuit is frivolous.', ""You assume the risk if you're engaged in baseball activity. For a coach to have a legal claim against a child for something like this is, for lack of a better word, preposterous."", ""The coach says he's just looking for an apology."", ""Our thanks to John Berman for that report. I want to bring back CNN legal analyst, Paul Callan, and Joey Jackson, HLN legal analyst, seen in this report. Joey, when I hear the words careless or reckless in a legal context, I think of people with grown minds who can establish what careless and reckless means. I don't think of a 14-year-old capable of understanding careless and reckless on the ball field."", ""Interestingly enough, in California, you can certainly sue a 14-year-old. That was proper. Here's the issue. Two fold, factual and legal. On the factual issue, is he claiming by throwing a helmet weighing one pound or less it severed his Achilles tendon. He was known to have coached 11 games after this. He says he went into shock and everything else. Did the ambulance respond? The factual issue is a problem for me. The legal issue is for when you're playing baseball, guess what, Ashleigh, things happen. When the contact occurs, can you say you had no idea? I believe this gets dismissed on summary judgment, which means it doesn't make it to trial."", 'What do you think?', ""I think Joey is right on this. When you play a sport like this, and as a coach, his job is to teach the 14-year-old about how to throw a helmet or not to throw a helmet. Now to turn around and say because the kid throws his hat in the air on a home run he's going to be sued or more specifically his parents may be liable is absolutely ridiculous. I think the courts will throw this out."", ""Here's the deal -- at first, I thought it was nuts, just nuts he would do this. On the other side of the coin, he's a volunteer, a parent. He's got this horrible medical issue."", ""That's -- you know -- that's why we have the lawsuits. You know why we have all the lawsuit, the concept everybody is a victim. Everybody has the right to be compensated for every bad thing that happens in life. Life is tough sometimes. By the way, this coach was assuming they had a homeowner's insurance policy and some insurance company would pay."", ""They don't have a policy. Now guess what, maybe the parents lose their house."", ""Everybody is thinking, there's insurance here. Let's give the guy some money."", ""There's no pot of gold."", ""Let's take a shot and the insurance company will settle."", ""He should know better, Ashleigh. I'm disappointed in this coach. You dedicate time for hockey, right?"", 'I do.', ""I don't see you suing anybody. You probably take a hit or two chasing kids around?"", '-- my friends. This is little mikes.', ""You know where this road leads? The end of little league baseball as more and more lawsuits get more and more expensive to get insurance. And that's why --"", '-- assumption of the risks.', '14 years old. Does it make difference this 14-year -- I\'m looking for the stats. He\'s like 6\'1"" or 6\'2"" and 180 pounds.', ""No, it doesn't, Ashleigh."", ""Let me repeat that. A 14-year-old we think as a tiny guy, he's big guy and he could be dangerous."", ""We're talking the helmet. We're not talking about him making any kind of connection. And this is was intent. If anything, you can argue it was recklessness. Where do we learn this from? The stars on TV. They hit the home run, slide and win, they throw their helmets. That's what this kid did. What's wrong with that?"", 'Support our kids. Support our communities. This guy is wrong.', ""We'll leave that one there. We'll see how this goes. We'll see if this does in fact get tossed out. I'm watching this box on the right-hand side of the screen. I don't want to miss the first play. Are we going to live to that or go to a break before hand? We're going to go live in because the first lady is being introduced as we speak. Let's get the live image up and let's hear from Michelle Obama."", 'Good morning. Thank you everyone. Thank you so much. Thank you.', ""You guys rest yourselves. Thank you so much. It is really great to be here today with all of you. We have with us today college and university presidents, experts and advocates and civic and business leaders. I want to thank all of you for taking the time to be here today and for working everyday to help young people pursue their education and build brighter futures for themselves and our country. I'd also like us to give a really big hand to Troy for sharing that story."", 'Thank you.', ""Troy's story lies within all of our young people no matter where they come from or how much money they have. Troy's story is why we should care deeply about this issue. Troy and others are why I care deeply about this issue. Troy and others are why I care so much about this issue and why in the coming years I'm going to spend more and more of my time focusing on education. As everyone here knows education is the key to success for so many kids. My goal specifically is to reach out directly to young people and encourage them to take charge of their futures and complete an education beyond high school. I'm doing this because so often when we talk about education we talk about our young people and what we need to do for them. We talk about the programs we need to create for them, the resources we need to devote to them. We must remember that education is a two way bargain. While there is so much more we must do for our kids, at the end of the day, as Troy described the person who has the most say over whether or not a student succeeds is the student him or herself. Ultimately they are the ones sitting in that classroom, ones that have to set goals for themselves and work hard to achieve those goals every single day. My hope is with this new effort, instead of talking about our kids, we talk with our kids. I want to hear what's going on in their lives. I want to inspire them to step up and commit to education so they can have opportunities they never dreamed of. I'm doing this because that story of opportunity through education is the story of my life. I want them to know that it can be their story too. Only, only if they devote themselves to continuing their education past high school. For many student, that might mean attending a college or university like the ones you represent. For others, it might mean choosing a community college, pursuing short term professional training. No matter what they do, I want to make sure students believe they have what it takes to succeed beyond high school. That's going to be my message to young people. But here's the thing. I know that message alone isn't enough. Like I said, this is a two way street. That means we all have to step up because make no mistake about it, these kids are smart. They will notice if we're not holding up our end of the bargain. They will notice if we tell them about applying for college or financial aid but then no one is there to help them choose the right school or fill out the right forms. They will notice if we tell them that they're good enough to graduate from college but then no college asks them to apply. No college invites them to visit their campus. So we've got to recommit ourselves to helping these kids pursue their education. As you discussed in your first panel today, one of the first steps is getting more underserved young people onto college campuses. The fact is that right now we are missing out on so much potential because so many promising young people like Troy who have the talent it takes to succeed simply don't believe college can be a realty to them. Too many are falling through the cracks. All of you know that all too well. That's why so many of you are finding new ways to reach out to the underserved students in your communities. You're helping them navigate the financial aid and college admissions process and helping them find schools that match their abilities and interests. I know from my own experience just how important all of that work is that you're doing. See, the truth is that if Princeton hadn't found my brother as a basketball recruit, and if I hadn't seen that he could succeed on a campus like that, never would have occurred to me to apply to that school, never. I know there are so many kids out there like me. Kids who have a world of potential, but maybe their parents never went to college, or maybe they've never been encouraged to believe they could succeed there. That means it's our job to find those kids. It's our job to help them understand their potential and get them enrolled in a college that can help them meet their needs. Get them enrolled in a college. That's not always easy, especially given what many kids are dealing with when they get to campus. Just think about it. You heard a snip from Troy. Just to make it to college, these kids have already overcome so much. Neighborhoods riddled with crime and drugs, moms and dads who weren't around. Too many nights they had to go to bed hungry. As I tell these kids when I talk to them, we can't think about those experiences that they've had as weaknesses, just the opposite. They're actually strengths. These kids have developed skills like grit and resilience that many of their peers will never be able to compete with, never. When they get out in the world, those are the exact skills they will need to succeed. They will succeed. Imagine how hard it is to realize that when you first get to college. You're in a whole new world. You might have trouble making friends because you don't see peers that come from a background like yours. You may be worried about paying for classes, food and room and board because you have never set your budget before. You may be feeling guilty when you call home because mom and dad are wondering why you didn't get a job to help support their family. Those are obstacles kidding are facing from day one. Let's be clear. All of that isn't just a challenge for them. It's a challenge for folks like us committed to helping them succeed. Make no mistake, that's our mission. Not raising money or hosting conferences but to take real meaningful action to help our young people get into college and more importantly get their actual degree. Here's the good news, time and again you have all shown you have the experience, passion, and the resources to help these young people thrive. For example, in recent decades you've realized students from across the socioeconomic spectrum are coming to campus with issues like eating disorders, learning disabilities, challenges like depression and anxiety and much more. Luckily, you have not shied away from these issues. I've seen it, worked at a university. You haven't said these aren't our problems. No, you've stepped up. While there's still work left to do on these issues, you're working everyday to support kids through treatment programs, outreach initiatives and support groups. You know these issues have a huge impact on whether students can learn and succeed at your school. So now as you begin to see more and more underserved students on your campuses, we need you to direct that same energy and determination toward helping these kids face their unique challenges. Now fortunately you've already got the expertise you need to address these issues. Simply by building on by what you're already doing best, you can make real differences for these kids. That's what so many are doing with commitments made at this summit. For example, every school offers financial aid services. Listen what University of Minnesota is doing. They're committing to expand to include financial literacy programs to help students and their families manage the cost of college. Every school has advisors who desperately want students to succeed. Oregon Tech is committing to set up a text message program so advisors can connect more easily with students who need extra encouragement or academic support. Every college has orientation programs or learning communities to help students transition to college. Many schools here today are supplementing those programs by partnering with organizations like the posse foundation so that underserved students can connect and build a social network before they even step foot on campus. Those were the types of resources that helped a kid like me, not just survive, but thrive at a school like Princeton. When I first arrived at school, I didn't know anyone on right buildings. I didn't even bring the right size sheets for my dorm room bed. I didn't realize those beds were so long. So I was a little overwhelmed and a little isolated. But then I had an opportunity to participate in a three-week on campus orientation program that helped me get the feel for the rhythm of college life. And once school started I discovered the campus cultural center, the third world center, where I found students and staff who came from families and communities that were similar to my own. And they understood what was going through. They were there to listen when I was feeling frustrated. They were there to answer the questions I was too embarrassed to ask anyone else. And if it weren't for those resources, and the friends, and the mentors, I honestly don't know how I would have made it through college. But instead I graduated at the top of my class, I went to law school. And you know the rest. So whether it's aligning with an organization like posse or offering a new advising or mentoring program or creating a central space where students can connect with one another, you all can take simple steps that can determine whether these kids give up and drop out or step up and thrive. And that's not just good for these young people, it's good for your schools because if you embrace and empower these students and if you make sure they have good campus experiences, then they're going to stay engaged with your school for decades after they graduate. They will be dressed up in school colors at homecoming games. They'll be asking to serve on your committees and advisory boards. And they'll be doing their part when fundraising season rolls around. So believe me, these will be some of the best alumni you could possibly ask for. Because after everything these kids will have overcome to get into college and get through college, believe me, they will have all the skills they need to run our businesses and our labs and to teach in our classrooms and to lead our communities. Just look at me and look at Troy and the countless success stories from the organizations and schools represented here in this room. That's how we will win, this country. We will win by tapping the full potential of all of our young people so that we can grow our economy and move this country forward. Let me tell you that is something that my husband understands deeply because his life story, just like mine, is rooted in education as well. And as president that is what drives him every single day. His goal of expanding opportunity to millions of Americans who are striving to build better futures for themselves, for their families and for our country as well. So now it is my pleasure to introduce my husband, the president of the United States, Barack Obama."", ""Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody please have a seat. Have a seat. Welcome to the White House, everybody. And let me begin by thanking Troy and sharing his remarkable story. I could not be more inspired by, you know, what he's accomplished and can't wait to see what he's going to accomplish in the future. My wife -- it's hard to speak after her."", ""-- just keep that in mind. Now, we are here for one purpose, we want to make sure more young people have the chance to earn a higher education. And in the 21st century economy we all understand it's never been more important. The good news is that our economy is steadily growing and strengthening after the worst recession in a generation. So we've created more than 8 million new jobs, manufacturing is growing led by a booming auto industry. Thanks to some key public investments in advances like affordable energy and, you know, research and development, what we've seen is not only an energy revolution in this country that bodes well for our future, but in areas like health care for example we've slowed the growth of health care costs in ways that a lot of people wouldn't have anticipated as recently as five or 10 years ago. So there are a lot of good things going on in the economy. And businesses are starting to invest. In fact, what we're seeing are businesses overseas starting to say instead of outsourcing let's source back into the U.S. All that bodes well for our future. Here's the thing though, we don't grow just for the sake of growth. We grow so that it translates into a growing middle class, people getting jobs, people being able to support their families and people being able to pass something on to the next generation. We want to restore the essential promise of opportunity and upward mobility that's at the heart of America. The notion that if you work hard, you can get ahead. You can improve your situation in life. You can make something of yourself. That the same essential story Troy so eloquently told about himself. And the fact is it's been getting harder to do that for a lot of people. It is harder for folks to start in one place and move up that ladder. And that was true long before the recession hit. And that's why I've said that in 2014 we have to consider this a year of action, not just to grow the economy, not just to increase GDP, not just to make sure that corporations are profitable and the stock market's doing well and the financial system is stable. We've also got to make sure that that growth is broad based and everybody has a chance to access that growth and take advantage of it. We've got to make sure that we're creating new jobs and that the wages and benefits that go along with those jobs can support a family. We have to make sure that there are new ladders of opportunity in the middle class and that those ladders, the rungs on those ladders are solid and accessible for more people. Now, I'm going to be working with Congress where I can to accomplish this. But I'm also going to act on my own if Congress is deadlocked. I've got a pen to take executive actions where Congress won't. And I've got a telephone to rally folks around the country on this mission. And today is a great example of how without a whole bunch of new legislation we can advance this agenda. We've got philanthropists and business leaders here. We've got leaders of innovative non for profits, we've got college presidents from state universities and historically black colleges to Ivy League universities and community colleges. And today more than 100 colleges and 40 organizations are announcing new commitments to help more young people not only go to but graduate from college. And that's an extraordinary accomplishment. And we didn't pass a bill to do it. Everybody here is participating, I believe, because you know that college graduation has never been more valuable than it is today. Unemployment for Americans with a college degree is more than a third lower than the national average, incomes twice as high as those without a high school diploma. College is not the only path to success. We've got to make sure that more Americans of all age are getting the skills that they need to access the jobs that are out there right now. But more than ever a college degree is the surest path to a stable middle class life. And higher education speaks to something more than that. The premise that we're all created equal is the opening line in our American story, and we don't promise equal outcomes. We strive to deliver equal opportunity. The idea that success does not depend on being born in a wealth of privilege, depends on effort and merit.""]","['ASHLEIGH BANFIELD, CNN ANCHOR', 'JOHN BERMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over)', 'JOE PARIS, FATHER', 'RAEGAN PARIS, MOTHER', 'BERMAN', 'ALAN BECK, LITTLE LEAGUE COACH', 'JOE PARIS', 'BERMAN', 'RAEGAN PARIS', 'BERMAN', 'BECK', 'BERMAN', 'JOEY JACKSON, HLN LEGAL ANALYST', 'BERMAN', 'BANFIELD', 'JACKSON', 'BANFIELD', 'PAUL CALLAN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST', 'BANFIELD', 'CALLAN', 'CALLAN', 'CALLAN', 'JACKSON', 'CALLAN', 'JACKSON', 'BANFIELD', 'JACKSON', 'BANFIELD', 'CALLAN', 'CALLAN', 'BANFIELD', 'JACKSON', 'BANFIELD', 'JACKSON', 'JACKSON', 'BANFIELD', 'MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITE STATES', 'MICHELLE OBAMA', 'TROY', 'MICHELLE OBAMA', 'BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES', 'BARACK OBAMA']"

And then this is the first time in the Summit's 20 year history that Cuba has been allowed to attend. It's also the setting for the new diplomatic dynamic between the U.S. and Cuba as relations continues to saw (ph). President Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro shook hands in Panama City last night. You see right there. And today the leaders are meeting face to face at the summit and that would be the first meeting of its kind between the two countries since 1959, when Vice President Richard Nixon met with then Prime Minister Fidel Castro. Jim Acosta is in Panama City. So Jim what more can you tell us about this meeting, is it happening now, has it happened, what are they've been talking about, what's the tone all of that good stuff?"", ""Yeah, a lot of good stuff to talk about. It's interesting to watch. This is really history in the making Fredricka, this countries have been cold war adversaries for more than half of century. And what you're seeing now is that eyes being shift away. The president just wrapped up remarks a few moments ago here at the Summit of the Americas. He talked about how he's trying to usher in a new relationship with the people of Cuba talking about really ending a practice of what he describe as U.S. meddling in Latin America. And this was as Raul Castro was in the room sitting just a few feet away from him. And so, you know, we should point out that Raul Castro the Cuban leader is speaking right now. But before Raul Castro started speaking the president gave a fairly lengthy address to this fellow Latin American and western hemispheric leaders. And he said during that moment that--what he wants to see is really a new era in relations between the U.S. an d Cuba here's what he had to say."", ""The United States will not be imprisoned by the past. We're looking to the future and the policies that improve the lives of the Cuban people. And advance the interests of cooperation in the hemisphere. Now this shift in U.S. policy represents a turning point for our entire region."", ""And the president went on to say it was sort of a moment when he was lecturing some of these more lefties Latin American leaders where he said, you know, what you can't blame the United States for all of your problems. And that he as president of the United States is going to continue to speak out on human rights on issues involving a political prisoners that that is not going to change despite this new overtures and this normalizing of relations with Cuba. And then Fredricka very interestingly after that, after the president of the United States spoke, Raul Castro took the microphone and he started speaking for several minutes. As matter of fact he still speaking right now, he's been going on for about 30 minutes. He said he's trying to makeup for the last time given the fact that this is the first summit that he's been invited too. And he ran through the litany of grievances at the Cuban people and that the Cuban government has against the United States, supporter past dictators, of the fact that the U.S. still controls a naval base in Guantanamo. So this was sort of a cold war of post cold war moment that we're seeing taking place here this afternoon. Now as for that meeting that's going to be coming up we do expect that to happen after this remarks. And we should have more on that later on this afternoon Fredricka."", 'All right and maybe quite simply put, you know, Jim its part of the family DNA, his Fidel has known to be very loquacious as well.', ""That's right, I think so."", 'All right Jim Acosta.', ""I think it's exactly right."", ""All right thank you so much, keep us posted there from Panama City, Panama.

Because it is the headquarters of Nike. That is the brand almost every American knows well. But why there? It's really all about trade, free trade, with an 11 nation group. And if the deal that the President wants to go through actually goes through, it could make a big difference for 11 countries and the United States. And some people say a good difference and some people say a bad difference, and of course that's always been the argument when you talk about that kind of a trade pack, the likes of which we haven't seen since NASDAQ 20 years ago. We are also waiting to find out if President Obama is going to address this breaking news story today about the increased threat level at American military basis on the Continental United States. We are now at forced protection bravo, increased from forced protection. Alpha, nothing specific being listed except for that constant drumbeat of threats from ISIS. And of course so many of these suggestions that there are homegrown terrorists among us that may be targeting military bases. And as we await this breaking news from the President, we are also looking at the other coast. We want to draw your attention to Seaford, New York on Long Island where the funeral for a fallen New York Police officer named Brian Moore is taking place where we shot on Saturday while he was on duty in Queens. He and his partner were in their car. They were questioning a potential suspect, had something in its waistband and he grabbed it. It was a gun and he open fired on him and then he hit Moore straight in the head. It happened so fast they had no chance to return fire. Here is where it gets interesting. Today, about 30,000 police officers and people are expected to attend this funeral, 30,000 police officers of course from New York, but also from right across the country. JetBlue offered to pay for their flight if they came to this funeral. The flags at city and state government buildings had been flying at Half-Staff in memory of Officer Brian Moore and that's been going on all week. After the shooting, Officer Moore was taken to the hospital. He was there in critical condition until he died on Monday. Jean Casarez our correspondent now in New York joins me from Seaford, New York and with me here in the studio is New York Retired NYPD Detective Perry Hub (ph). First to you Jean Casarez on the ground, 30,000 people attending. Take me there and set the scene please."", 'Ashleigh, thousands upon thousands of police officers from all around the country are here to honor this fallen officer of the N.Y.P.D. People have come from the community and I ask them, why? And they say ""Because we want to honor his family."" For the fact is, this young man, 25 years old, Officer Brian Moore had been a member of the force almost five years, two accommodation medals. The funeral is taking place right now. And the priest that\'s officiating said that he had a vocation to serve in law enforcement, a vocation to go into the trouble not away from it. His family wanted a miracle, a miracle they did not get.', ""And Jean, just that in terms of the sheer volume of people who have shown up there, look, we just went through two New York City police officer's funeral and there were up to 25,000 people that came, many of them officers from all around the country. And now we're looking at 30,000. How safe does it -- as it seems there, I hate to even say that with that many police officers that it's also frightening to think that these are often targets of opportunity for terrorist."", ""Well, there's heightened security here, no question. First of all, I have seen the New York City counter terrorism squad here. There are officers positioned on the top of the building with their binoculars all to make this area safe. But inside, they are celebrating the life right now of an officer taken far too soon. Officer Brian Moore was 25 years old, the son, nephew and cousin of police officers. He joined the NYPD in July of 2010. New York Police Commissioner William Bratton says Moore had a commitment to the job that made him stand out."", ""In his very brief career, less than five years, he'd already proved himself to be an exceptional young officer. In that career, he had made over 150 arrests, protecting and serving the citizens of the city. He'd already received two exceptional police service medals, two meritorious police service medals. We don't give them out easily. We're proud (inaudible)."", ""More also had a connection to Baltimore, Maryland, his favorite team, the Baltimore Orioles. On Tuesday, the Orioles played the Met. Moore had bought tickets to attend the game with his girlfriend and father, a retired N.Y.P.D. sergeant. When the Mets heard about it, they honored more wearing N.Y.P.D. hats during batting practice. There was a moment of silence in his memory. Baltimore first baseman Chris Davis was Moore's favorite player. He presented the family with a signed baseball. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio met with his parents. He said serving as a New York Police Officer was Moore's dream. He did everything a good officer is supposed to do."", 'We need to be there for the Moore family and we need to be thankful that there was a hero amongst us known as Brian Moore.', ""And New York's mayor is speaking live right now at the St. James Roman Catholic Church at the funeral. Let's listen in."", ""Our heart broken, as are the people of our city. Brian Moore dedicated his life to protecting all of us. He gave what President Abraham Lincoln called the last full measure of devotion to that cause. Our hearts today are heavy and our hearts are with the Moore family, with Brian's father Raymond, his mother Irene, his sister Christine, all of the members of his family but also all the members of his extending family at the N.Y.P.D. and particularly with the men and women of the 104 precinct who he served with over these past five years. Brian Moore represented the best of New York City. He was brave. For sure but his bravery was matched by his compassion and it came by it through his family, it's in his DNA from a family so devoted to the N.Y.P.D. His father and uncle both retired sergeants. As three cousins, police officers one, and the NYPD two, and police forces in Long Island. Brian looked up to his father in every way and sought to emulate him and did a fine job, and not just when something as important as patrolling the streets and keeping us safe, and other matters as well. Brian took after his father and was a devout Baltimore Orioles fan like him. And Raymond, I want to say I admire your choice to bring up your son supporting a different team in the American League East. I think it was one of the many reasons your son had the tremendous character that he has. In middle school, Brian already knew still so early on he knew the path he wanted to walk. He knew he wanted to carry on the noble tradition and become a member of the N.Y.P.D. He didn't wait a moment. The age of 17 he had already taken the N.Y.P.D. entrance exam. He just couldn't wait to be old enough to join the force. And when he got their, when he finally became an officer, he didn't it halfway, he devoted his whole being to the job, he cared so deeply, he work so hard, a stories I've heard and we've all heard in last days. Young man who cared so deeply to do the job right. He learned quickly, he was constantly asking questions became clear to many he was a rising star. And a few short years he had made it to the elite anticrime unit. It was respected by his elders, and he was looked up to by junior officers and regardless of seniority all son has a friend. Even at the age of 25, others flock to him seeking advice and guidance. He was a consummate professional. By the same time he had a tremendous ability to enjoy life. He never took himself too seriously. He always found the joy in what he did. And then the deep bonds he felt with others. His enthusiasm and his smile were infectious. Do you photos is obvious those around him felt joy in his presence. People want to work him. If Brian was doing something they wanted to be part of it. He was always ready with a joke. And he is always ready for a friendly competition. And ready to won up his friends and fellow officers, off duty as well. He live life to the fullest. He loved many, many things and people. He loved everything about the life that he had created. He was devoted to his german shepherd Smoky, he loved his copper black Accura. And he excelled at making his own home made videos filmed while singing to the radio, his own version of karaoke. Acting out songs and then sharing them with his friends. All those things mattered so much to him. His work and things he loved to do. But nothing mattered more than his family. Clearly above all in his life, he cherished family the most. He love to spend time with his father, he went to baseball games, he went bowling. He also make sure that every Monday his day off, was a time he devoted to his mother. That was a time that he kept sacred to make sure he had that time with her. Wherever he was, whatever..."", ""As the mayor continues to address the church on Long Island, I want to take you to the President who's about to speak live at the Nike headquarters in Beaverton Oregon. It is a bid trade deal that's being announced he is entering now to try to pitch this nation and other obviously on a pacific free trade zone. Nike says it will create thousands and thousands of jobs. Critiques say it will send the whole bunch of jobs into cheaper labor countries that don't respect their rights as much. It is a contentious issue even among his fellow Democrats. But he is pushing hard. And with him is also Mark Parker the president CEO of Nike. Let's listen."", ""Hello Oregon. Wow. Who arrange this thing? Every time I come to Oregon this is what it looks like. Yeah, the -- it never rains in Oregon doesn't it. Never."", '... California.', ""All right. Well listen it is wonderful to see all of you, first of all please give Mark another round of applause for his hospitality. And thanks to everyone at Nike for hosting us today here in federal plots. You know, the White House is cool. We got a basketball court. Actually it's a tennis court that we repainted some lines when I came in the office. So it's a combination basketball tennis court. There is a punning green that President Eisenhower were put in. Can you imagine by the way if I'd put in punning green. Things have changed. But you got all that and the 18th tee box from Petal beach. Come on. I'm sure some of my staff is running around right now in the Michael Jordan and Mia Hamm buildings. They want to be lab rats for your new gear. But it is wonderful to be here. Please give it up for two people who fight every single day for Oregon workers, your representatives in congress, they do a great job. Earl Blumenauer and Suzanne Bonamici, they are both here. Give them big round of applause. Yehey. And there are two people who couldn't make it here today. But they're doing a great job and you should give them around of applause, Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Kurt Schrader. So it is great to be at the world headquarters, such an iconic company. The company that helps athletes succeed from the individual to the world stage. And as you've heard I've come to Oregon to talk a little bit about trade. Which initially may have had some people thinking what is maybe go (ph) in some place that we didn't know about or yeah. And he's going to be great. He's an outstanding young man, he's going to be terrific and from Hawaii by the way. You know, local boy. But this is important and I want to tell you why I think trade deals and our willingness to go out there and compete on the global stage is so important. You know, before I came out here, had a chance to meet with some small business owners from across Oregon. Whose workers make everything from bikes, to tea, to stationary, to wine. And they know how important this is to them. Sometimes when we talk about trade we think of Nike or we think of Boeing or we think of GE, we think about this big multinational companies. But those small business leaders came here today because they understood that these markets outside the United States will help them grow. And will help them hire more folks. Just as all the suppliers to Nike or Boeing or GE or any of these other companies understand this is going to be critical to their growth and their ability to create new jobs. In fact that's why Ron Wyden is not here because he's in Washington D.C. as we speak quarterbacking this effort on behalf of Oregon small business owners and workers. The small businesses are backbone of our economy eventually like Nikes they grow sometimes in the really, really big companies. They employ millions of people. 98 percent of exporters are small businesses. They're the once who made an Oregon and made in the U.S.A. mean something and they represent something essential about this country the notion that if you got to good idea and you're willing to work at it you can turn that idea into a business, you can grow that business, eventually who knows what might happen. You can give other people a chance to earn a living even as you do well. That's America's promise. And it's up to us to keep that promise a lot. Now that promise was threatened for almost everybody just about seven year ago, when the economy nearly collapsed, and millions of American's lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings."", ""As the president continues his discussion pitching the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal he's got a big selling congress for this by the way. But he thinks it's a great deal that it will create thousands of jobs. Nike share was once said as well and says they'll create I think 40,000 if that deal goes through pardon me 10,000 if the accord is approved by the United States congress. We're going to continue to monitor, to see if he has in the reference points for this new threat level that has been raised today on the Continental United States every military base now has a force protection bravo it will operate under, you will see some of the changes and you won't see some of the changes in security protocols at those bases. We're continuing to watch the president and we have that breaking story in Atlanta, where a Piper went down on the freeway. We are now live on the ground with our shots as the NTSB is starting to sort through some of the rubble that is remarkable to see that an aircraft carrying four people could be reduced to that in a concrete barrier in between two different directions of that freeway.

Observers say it's the worst fighting the region has experienced in months. Well, rescuers China are struggling to find survivors two days after a cruise ship capsized in the Yangtze River. I want to show you this animation. It shows the route the Eastern Star was taking when it overturned in the country's longest river. Now, more than 410 of the more than 450 people onboard are still missing. At last report, 14 survivors had been rescued, and 26 bodies recovered. Let's get an update from our David McKenzie.

Give us some sense of what's happening there with the rescue operation."", ""Well, Robyn, the rescue operation is continuing. This hospital behind me there had hoped that there were many more survivors coming in, but the survivors have really not come in today, and it's a really grim task, though, with some hope left, that they might find someone perhaps trapped in an air pocket, deep air pocket, deep inside that hull on the Yangtze River. They've expanded the operation, the search operation, by more than a hundred kilometers down river of the vessel that overturned. That indicates to me just how far they're hoping potentially to find survivors and potentially those who have been lost. And, yes, they're drilling into the hull. They're cutting it open, trying to get divers in. There have been some amazing tales of people getting out, of being -- tapping and calling and even whistling from inside the hull, but it's been very difficult today to get answers and very little hope, in fact, on the scene, Robyn."", ""I know that many families have got a lot of questions. There's some anger at the information that authorities are giving them about how this happened. Do we know -- I mean, I know it was a storm, some severe weather, but how did a storm overturn such a huge ship?"", ""Well, that's the question right now is, whether it was a storm or a tornado. According to some officials in China, how could it have lilted the ship over in such a fast way that the captain and the mechanic got off the ship, and, yet, so many people presumably are still trapped there? So that is the question. Why wasn't an alarm sounded? Why did the alarm come out from the shore so many hours later? It does seem there was an extreme event of weather on the scene, but we have spoken to some families here who are coming in now from neighboring cities to try and get a sense of where their loved ones are. Let's listen to one man."", 'I have gone beyond the sadness. I am preparing for the worst while still holding onto hope.', 'One thing I want to do the most is to see my mom.', ""Well, certainly, that man, Mr. Woo (ph), his mother and his aunt and his two uncles were on board that vessel, so they're all here trying to get any sense of what happened, and the anger and sadness is certainly rising, Robyn."", ""Dave McKenzie, thanks so much. David there outside that hospital in Jianli Province. Thanks for that update. Well, a provincial Iraqi official tells CNN, ISIS has shut the gates of the Ramadi Dam. That will prevent water flowing to towns east of the city. Now the official says ISIS is planning to attack once the water level has dropped enough, and is also trying to, quote, kill people with thirst. The fall of Ramadi almost three weeks ago is why -- is but one recent example of the group's relentless drive.

All this, in the face of an international anti-ISIS coalition comprising some 60 nations and Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces numbering in the hundreds of thousands.', 'ISIL continues to commit serious, vicious crimes, and it still controls more territory than Al-qaeda ever did.', 'Crucially, ISIS has already achieved the goal contained in its name, establishing an Islamic state. It runs hospital, schools, and a business empire with an estimated daily income in the millions of dollars, and ISIS fighters and supporters appear to be true believers, devout to the point that they would sacrifice anything for a terrorist group some compare to a cult.', 'They believe that are, you know, the true Army of Islam that is coming to save Islam.

I'm Lynda Kinkade. First, let's check out what's happening at the G7 Summit in Germany. That's where we're waiting right now for US President Barack Obama who is about to speak. Mr. Obama came is to the summit with two major goals in mind. He met on the summit sideline a short time ago with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi to discuss the fight against ISIS. Mr. Al-Abadi is at the Summit looking for more military assistance. Mr. Obama wants to ease tensions with Iraq after US Defense Secretary recently suggested Iraqis lack the will to fight. In the meantime, Mr. Obama is also trying to get hesitant European leaders to extend sanctions against Russia. Again, the president is set to speak at any moment now. We will bring you those comments live as soon he appears. Now to South Africa where we've got an update on Oscar Pistorius. The former Olympian sprinter could soon get out of prison. A parole board is set to recommend the blade runner be released in August. The double- amputee was sentenced to five years in prison last year for culpable homicide or unintentional killing of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Robyn Curnow is following the developments from Johannesburg and joins us now live. Robyn, this timing is not surprising. It is in line with correctional service recommendations. What can you tell us?"", ""Yes, so one-sixth of his sentence will be served. If, indeed, this does go ahead, there is still room if some higher-ups within corrections services of Africa's Department of Correctional Services, which oversees the prisons, steps in; however, that doesn't look to be likely at this point. We also can tell you that Pistorius will be placed under house arrest once he is released, and if, perhaps, the Supreme Court of Appeals which is due to begin looking at the case right -- the prosecution has asked that the Supreme Court of Appeals look at his case, and, perhaps, it might even overturn Judge Masipa's original sentence to, obviously, just five years for a culpable homicide. It could actually go into murder if -- he could be found guilty of murder instead of culpable homicide by then, and if this does happen, then he could be headed back to jail, but this, of course, is occurring at some point in November."", ""Has there been any reaction yet from Reeva Steenkamp's family?"", ""Yes. According to local news, she -- her family was shocked and very disappointed with this news that he could get out in August. They also presented a -- quite a heartbreaking letter to the parole board. I'll read a little bit of it, so saying that although they have forgiven Mr. Pistorius for taking the life of their precious daughter, a person found guilty of a crime must be held accountable for their actions, and they state, 10 months for taking a life is simply not enough. We fear that this will send out the proper message and serve as the deterrent it should."", ""Okay. So for now, even if he's out in August, his legal battles won't be over. He's still facing that court case in November. Robyn Curnow, thank you very much for joining us. We appreciate it. Russia and Qatar say they're moving ahead with plans to host the next two World Cups despite a warning from FIFA's compliance chief. He says both nations could lose the right to host the tournament if there's evidence bribes helped them secure winning bids. Meanwhile, the BBC reports that documents implicate former FIFA Vice President, Jack Warner, in a multi-million dollar bribery scandal. Fred Pleitgen is pulling together all these strands at this time and joins us now from London. Fred, the biggest development is that comment coming from FIFA threatening to pull those forthcoming World Cups you've covered overseas, the Brazil World Cup and it's that tournament that is getting -- there's a lot of focus on that tournament right now."", ""There's a lot of focus on that one. There's a lot of focus on the World Cup 2010 as well; especially, if you look at the allegations against Jack Warner. Also, if you look at some of the things that have been pointed out in the Sunday Times, the English newspaper, over this weekend. Now, as far as Jack Warner is concerned, the BBC has come out and said that it has seen some parts of an account that was controlled by Jack Warner that seems to very strongly indicate that $10 million that were wired to that account from FIFA, were, in fact, not used for football development as they should have been in the Caribbean, but, rather, that they were put to personal use. Now, we have to keep in mind that these $10 million were put on that account controlled by Jack Warner by FIFA at the request of South Africa after it won the bid for the World Cup 2010, so, certainly, there are some people who believe there might be some irregularities there, and then, of course, then you have the Sunday Times reporting where it put out videos that had FIFA executives on those videos openly stating that there was bribing going on in the run-up to the World Cup bidding in 2010 between the -- especially, Morocco and South Africa. And there was even one official who said that most of those involved in that vote believed that Morocco actually had the most votes to host that World Cup; however, that in the end it was awarded to South Africa, so there's a lot of things that came out over the weekend, a lot of new information that's come out about new allegations that certainly seems to be fueling these flames here as far as this FIFA scandal is concerned, Lynda."", ""It's not going to go away any time soon. Fred Pleitgen. We appreciate --"", 'Yeah.', ""-- your time today. Thank you very much. And Trinidad and Tobago's justice minister wants Jack Warner to go to New York to face trial on corruption charges. Robyn Curnow talked about Warner's legal situation earlier with the country's attorney general, Gavin Nicholas. He says Warner's status as a politician and former FIFA Vice President, will not impact efforts to bring him to justice."", ""If Mr. Warner is found to be guilty of these charges, or that there is sufficient evidence for him to be extradited, he should be extradited. Trinidad and Tobago's justice system is solid, and we are very well respected in terms of our democracy, in terms of our legal system, in terms of our financial system in Trinidad and Tobago, and there is absolutely no reason to suggest that anyone is above the law and should (inaudible) to be. Well, it's a big fish for the Americans, and, as you know, he's not the only fish. There are 13 other fish in the sea, and I suspect they're going through the same procedure as Mr. Warner will be going through. I think it's very, very important to note that there are, indeed, others involved in this from other parts of the world including the United States of America, including the United Kingdom, including Switzerland, and just as they would be subject to their legal proceedings, so, too, will Mr. Jack Warner."", ""Warner has publicly denied all charges against him, but we want to hear from him personally. Here's what happened when Robyn Curnow tried to track down the former FIFA Vice President in Trinidad and Tobago."", 'The list of football officials facing corruption charges is extensive, but for international law enforcement, none would be a greater get than Jack Warner, former FIFA Vice President and the biggest power in sports throughout the Americas for two decades. As claims against the 72- year-old mount, we went to find him in his island home flying from Atlanta to Miami and all across the Caribbean to this dot on the map, now, arguably, the eye of the FIFA storm. A quick drive through.....', ""We're going to break into this story now. President Obama is speaking at the G7 Summit. Let's listen in."", ""You know, one of the pleasures of being president is scouting out places that you want to come back to, where you don't have to spend all your time in a conference room. The setting is breath-taking. Our German friends have been absolutely wonderful, and the success of this summit is a tribute their outstanding work. G7 represents some of the largest economies in the world, but in our G7 partners, the United States also embraces some of our strongest allies and closest friends in the world, so even as we work to promote the growth that creates jobs and opportunity, we're also here to stand up for the fundamental principles that we share as democracies for freedom, for peace, for the right of nations and peoples to decide their own destiny, for universal human rights and the dignity of every human being, and I'm pleased that here in Krun, we showed that on the most pressing global challenges, America and our allies stand united. We agree that the best way to sustain the global economic recovery is by focusing on jobs and growth. That's what I'm focused on in the United States. On Friday we learned that our economy created another 280,000 jobs in May, the strongest month of the year so far, and more than three million new jobs over the past year, nearly the fastest pace in over a decade. We've now seen five straight years of private sector job growth, 12.6 million new jobs created, the longest streak on record. The unemployment is near its lowest level in seven years. Wages for American workers continue to rise, and since I took office, the United States has cut our deficit by two-thirds, so in the global economy, America is a major source of strength. At the same time, we recognize that the global economy, while growing, is still not performing at its full potential, and we agreed on a number of necessary steps. Here in Europe, we support efforts to find a path that enables Greece to carry out key reforms and return to growth within a strong, stable, and growing Eurozone. I updated my partners on our effort with Congress to fast trade promotion authority so we can move ahead with TPP in the Asia Pacific region and TTIP here in Europe. Agreements with high standards to protect workers, public safety and the environment. We continue to make progress toward a strong global climate agreement this year in Paris. All the G7 countries have now put forward our post-2020 targets for reducing carbon emissions and will continue to urge other significant emitters to do so as well. We'll continue to meet our climate finance commitments to help developing countries to transition to low-carbon growth. As we've done in the US, the G7 agreed on the need to integrate climate risks into development assistance and investment programs across the board, and to increase access to risk insurance to help developing countries respond to and recover from climate-related disasters, and building on the Power Africa initiative I launched two years ago, the G7 will work to mobilize more financing for clean energy projects in Africa. With respect to security, the G7 remains strongly united in support for Ukraine. We'll continue to provide economic support and technical assistance that Ukraine needs as it moves ahead on critical reforms to transform its economy and strengthen its democracy. As we've seen again in recent days, Russian forces continue to operate in Eastern Ukraine, violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Now, this is now the second year in a row that the G7 has met without Russia, another example of Russia's isolation, and every member of the G7 continues to maintain sanctions on Russia for its aggression against Ukraine. Now, it's important to recognize the Russian economy has been seriously weakened. The Ruble and foreign investment are down. Inflation is up. The Russian Central Bank has lost more than $150 billion in reserves. Russian banks and firms are virtually locked out of the international markets. Russian energy companies are struggling to import the services and technologies they need for complex energy projects. Russian defense firms have been cut off from key technologies. Russia is in deep recession, so Russia's actions in Ukraine are hurting Russia and hurting the Russian people. Here at the G7, we agreed that even as we will continue to seek a diplomatic solution, sanctions against Russia will remain in place so long as Russia continues to violate its obligations under the Minsk Agreements. Our European partners reaffirmed that they will maintain sanctions on Russia until the Minsk agreements are fully implemented, which means extending the EU's existing sectorial sanctions beyond July, and the G7 is making it clear that if necessary, we stand ready to impose additional significant sanctions against Russia. Beyond Europe, we discussed the negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, and we remain united heading into the final stages of the talks. Iran has a historic opportunity to resolve the international community's concerns about its nuclear program, and we agreed that Iran needs to seize that opportunity. Our discussions with Prime Minister Al-Abadi of Iraq, President Caid Essebsi of Tunisia and President Buhari of Nigeria, were a chance to address the threats of ISIL and Boko Haram. The G7 countries, therefore, agreed to work together and with our partners to further coordinate our counter-terrorism efforts. As many of the world's leading partners in global development joined by leaders of Ethiopia, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and the African Union, we discussed how to maximize the impact of our development partnerships. We agreed to continue our landmark initiative to promote food security and nutrition, part of our effort to lift 500 million people into developing countries out of hunger and malnutrition by 2030. We'll continue to work with our partners in West Africa to get ebola cases down to zero, and as part of our global health security agenda, I'm pleased that the G7 made a major commitment to help 60 countries over the next five years achieve specific targets to better prevent, detect, and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics. And, finally, I want to commend Chancellor Merkel for ensuring that this summit included a focus on expanding educational and economic opportunities for women and girls. The G7 committed to expanding career training for women in our own countries and to increase technical and vocational training in developing countries which will help all of our nations prosper. So, again, I want to thank Angela and the People of Germany for their extraordinary hospitality. I leave here confident that when it comes to the key challenges of our time, America and our closest allies stand shoulder-to-shoulder, so with that, I will take some questions, and I will start off with Jeff Mason of Reuters."", 'Thank you, Mr. President. After your meetings here, you mentioned Greece in your opening statement.', 'Uh-huh.', ""Do you believe that the Europeans are being too tough on Greece in these talks, and what else needs to be done on both sides to ensure there's a deal and to ensure that there isn't the undue harm to financial markets that you've warned about?"", 'Uh-huh.', ""And on a separate and somewhat related topic, the French told reporters today that you said at the -- to G7 leaders, that you're concerned that the dollar is too strong. What did you say exactly, and are you concerned that the dollar is too strong?"", ""First of all, don't believe unnamed courts. I did not say that, and I make a practice of not commenting on the daily fluctuations of the dollar or any other currency. With respect to Greece, I think that, not only our G7 partners, but the IMF and other institutions that were represented here, feel a sense of urgency in finding a path to resolve the situation there, and what it's going to require is Greece being serious about making some important reforms, not only to satisfy creditors, but more importantly, to create a platform, whereby; the Greek economy can start growing again and prosper, and so the Greeks are going to have to follow through and make some tough political choices that will be good for the long-term. I also think it's going to be important for the international community and the international financial agencies to recognize the extraordinary challenges that Greeks face, and if both sides are showing a sufficient flexibility, then I think we can get this problem resolved, but it will require some tough decisions for all involved, and we will continue to consult with all the parties involved to try to encourage that kind of out come."", 'Hoping it will happen before the deadline?', ""I think that everybody wants to make it happen, and they're working hard to get it done. Nedra."", 'Thank you, Mr. President. How frustrated are you that after you personally raised your concerned about cyber security with the Chinese President, that a massive attack on US personnel files seems to have originated from China? Was the Chinese Government involved? And, separately, as a sports fan, can you give us your reaction to the FIFA bribery scandal? Thank you.', ""With respect to FIFA, I can not comment on a pending case by our attorney general. I will say that in conversations I've had here in Europe, people think it is very important for FIFA to be able to operate with integrity and transparency and accountability, and so as the investigation and charges proceed, I think we have to keep in mind that, although, you know, football, soccer, depending on which side of the Atlantic you live on, is a game. It's a -- also a massive business. It is a source of incredible national pride, and people want to make sure that it operates with integrity. The United States, by the way, since we keep on getting better and better at each World Cup, you know, we want to make sure that, you know, a sport that is gaining popularity is conducted in a upright manner. I don't want to discuss -- because we haven't publicly unveiled who we think may have engaged in these cyber attacks, but I can tell you that we have known for a long time that there are significant vulnerabilities, and that these vulnerabilities are going to accelerate as time goes by; both in systems within government and within the private sector. This is why it's so important that Congress moves forward on passing cyber legislation, cyber security legislation that we've before pushing for. Why, you know, over the last several years, I've been standing up new mechanisms inside of government for us to investigate what happens and to start finding more effective solutions. Part of the problem is, is that we've got very old systems, and, you know, we discovered this new breach in OPM precisely because we've initiated this process of inventorying and upgrading these old systems to address existing vulnerabilities, and what we are doing is going agency by agency and figuring out, what can we fix with better practices and better computer hygiene by personnel. And where do we need new systems and new infrastructure in order to protect information, not just of government employees or government activities but also, most importantly, where there's an interface between government and the American people? And this is going to be a big project, and we're going to have to keep on doing it because both state and non-state actors are sending everything they've got at trying to breach these systems. In some cases, it's non-state actors who are engaging in criminal activity and potential theft. In the case of state actors, they're probing for intelligence, or, in some cases, trying to bring down systems in pursuit of their various foreign policy objectives. In either case, we're going to have to be much more aggressive, much more attentive, than we have been, and this problem is not going to go away. It's going to accelerate, and that means that we have to be as nimble, as aggressive, and as well-resourced as those who are trying to break into these systems. Justin Sink."", ""Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about two things that were on the agenda at the G7 this weekend, and the first is the Islamic State. You said yesterday ahead of your meeting with Prime Minister Cameron that you would assess what was working and what wasn't, so I was wondering, bluntly, what is not working in the fight against the Islamic State? And in today's bilateral, Prime Minister Al-Abadi requests you step up assistance to Iraq. I'm wondering if that includes additional US military personnel. Separately, on trade, Chancellor Merkel said today that she was pleased you would get fast-track authority. I'm wondering if that means that you gave her or other leaders here assurance that it would go through the house, and if it doesn't, what does it say about your ability to achieve meaningful agreements with Congress for the remainder of your time in office?"", ""Well, on the latter question, I'm not going to hypothesize about not getting it done. I intend to get it done, and, hopefully, we're going to get a vote soon because I think it's the right thing to do. With respect to ISIL, we have made significant progress in pushing back ISIL from areas in which they had occupied or disrupted local populations, but we've also seen there is -- like in Ramadi, where they're displaced in one place, and then they come back in another, and they're nimble, and they're aggressive and they're opportunistic, so one of the areas where we're going to have to improve is the speed at which we're training Iraqi forces. Where we've trained Iraqi forces directly and equipped them, and we have a train-and-assist posture, they operate effectively. Where we haven't, morale, lack of equipment, et cetera, may undermine the effectiveness of Iraqi security forces, so we want to get more Iraqi security forces trained, fresh, well-equipped and focused, and President Al-Abadi wants the same thing, so we're reviewing a range of plans for how we might do that, essentially, accelerating the number of Iraqi forces that are properly trained and equipped and have a focused strategy and good leadership, and when a finalized plan is presented to me by the Pentagon, then I will share it with the American People. It's not -- I -- we don't yet have a complete strategy because it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis as well about how recruitment takes place, how that training takes place, and so the details of that are not yet worked out."", ""Is it fair to say that additional military personnel, US military personnel, are part of what's under consideration?"", ""I think what is fair to say is that all the countries in the international coalition are prepared to do more to train Iraqi security forces if they feel like that additional work is being taken advantage of, and one of the things that we're still seeing is -- in Iraq, places where we've got more training capacity than we have recruits, so part of my discussion with Prime Minister Al-Abadi was, how do we make sure that we get more recruits in? A big part of the answer there is our outreach to Sunni tribes. We've seen Sunni tribes who are not only willing and prepared to fight ISIL, but have been successful at rebuffing ISIL, but it has not been happening as fast as it needs to, and so one of the efforts that I'm hoping to see out of Prime Minister Al-Abadi and the Iraqi legislature when they're in session is to move forward on a national guard law that would help to devolve some of the security efforts in places like Anbar to local folks and to get those Sunni tribes involved more rapidly. This is part of what helped defeat AQI, the precursor of ISIL, during the Iraq War in 2006. Without that kind of local participation, even if you have a short-term success, it's very hard to hold those areas. The other area where I -- we've got to make a lot more progress is on stemming the flow of foreign fighters. Now, you'll recall that I hosted a UN General's Security Council meeting specifically on this issue, and we've made some progress but not enough. We are still seeing thousands of foreign fighters flowing into first Syria, and then, oftentimes, ultimately, into Iraq, and not all of that is preventable, but a lot of it is preventable if we've got better cooperation, better coordination, better intelligence, if we are monitoring what's happening at the Turkish/Syria boarder more effectively. This is an area where we've been seeking deeper cooperation with Turkish authorities who recognize it's a problem, but haven't fully ramped up the capacity they need, and this is something that I think we got to spend a lot of time on. If we can cut off some of that foreign fighter flow, then we're able to isolate and wear out ISIL forces that are already there because we're taking a lot of them off the battlefield, but if they're being replenished, then it doesn't solve the problem over the long term. The final point that I've emphasized to Prime Minister Al-Abadi is the political agenda of inclusion remains as important as the military fight that's out there. If Sunnis, Kurds, and Shia all feel as if their concerns are being addressed, and that operating within a legitimate political structure can meet their need for security, prosperity, non-discrimination, then we're going to have a much easier time, and Prime -- the good news is Prime Minister Al-Abadi is very much committed to that principle, but, obviously, he's inheriting a legacy of a lot of mistrust between various groups in Iraq. He's having to take a lot of political risks. In some cases, their efforts to undermine those efforts by other political factions within Iraq, and so we've got to continue to monitor that and support those who are on the right side of the issue there. Kali (ph) Nelson. KALI (ph)"", 'Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned that the US and its European allies have reached a consensus on extending the sanctions against Russia.', 'Uh-huh.', ""Is there a consensus, though, about what specifically the next step should be if Russia continues to violate the Minsk Agreement, and, also, if -- can you deter Russian aggression in other parts of Eastern Europe without a permanent US troop presence? And, separately, I wanted to ask you about the possibility that the court battle over your actions on immigration could extend late into your term. Do you think that there's anything more that you can do for the people who would have benefitted from that program and now are in limbo?"", 'Uh-huh.', 'And how do you view the possibility of your term ending without accomplishing your goals on immigration?', ""On Ukraine and Russia and Minsk, there is strong consensus that we need to keep pushing Russia to abide by the terms of the Minsk Agreement. We need to continue to support and encourage Ukraine to meet its obligations under Minsk, that until that's completed, sanctions remain in place. There was discussion about additional steps that we might need to take if Russia, working through separatists, doubled down on aggression inside of Ukraine. We -- those discussions are taking place at a technical level, not yet at a political because I think the first goal here going into a European Council meeting that's coming up is just rolling over the existing sanctions, but I think at a technical level, we want to be prepared. Our hope is, is that we don't have to take additional steps because the Minsk Agreement is met, and I want to give enormous credit to Chancellor Merkel, along with President Rohl (ph), who have shown extraordinary stick-to-itiveness and patience in trying to get that done. Ultimately, this is going to be an issue for Mr. Putin. He's got to make a decision; does he continue to wreck his country's economy and continue Russia's isolation in pursuit of a wrong-headed desire to recreate the glories of the Soviet Empire? Or does he recognize that Russia's greatness does not depend on violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries? And, you know, the -- as I mentioned earlier -- the costs that the Russian People are bearing are severe. That's being felt. It may not always be understood why they're suffering because of state media inside of Russia and propaganda coming out of, you know, state media in Russia and to Russian speakers, but the truth of the matter is, is that the Russian People would greatly benefit, and, ironically, one of the rationales that Mr. Putin provided for his incursions into Ukraine was to protect Russian speakers there. Well, Russian speakers inside of Ukraine are precisely the ones who are bearing the brunt of the fighting. Their economy has collapsed. Their lives are disordered. Many of them are displaced. Their homes may have been destroyed. They're suffering. And the best way for them to stop suffering is if the Minsk Agreement is fully implemented. Christi Pars -- oh, immigration. With respect to immigration, obviously, I'm frustrated by a district court ruling that now is winding its way through the appeals process. We are being as aggressive as we can legally to, first and foremost, appeal that ruling, and then to implement those elements of immigration executive actions that were not challenged in court, but, obviously, the centerpiece, one of the key provisions for me was being able to get folks who are undocumented to go through a background check, criminal background check, pay back taxes and then have a legal status, and that requires an entire administrative apparatus, and us getting them to apply and come clean. I made a decision, which I think is the right one, that we should not accept applications until the legal status of this is clarified. I am absolutely convinced this is well within my legal authority, the Department of Homeland Security's legal authority. If you look at the precedent, if you look at the traditional discretion that the executive branch possesses when it comes to applying immigration laws, I am convinced that what we're doing is lawful and our lawyers are convinced that what we're doing is lawful, but, you know, the United States is a government of laws and separations of power, and when a -- even if it's an individual district court judge who's making this determination, we've got to go through the process to challenge it, and until we get clarity there, I don't want to bring people in, have them apply, and jump through a lot of hoops only to have it deferred and delayed further. Of course, there's one really great way to solve this problem, and that would be Congress going ahead and acting, which would obviate the need for executive actions. The majority of the American People, I think, still want to see that happen. I suspect it will be a major topic the next presidential campaign, and so we will continue to push as hard as we can on all fronts to fix a broken immigration system administratively. We'll be prepared if and when we get the kind of ruling that I think we should have gotten in the first place about of our authorities to go ahead and implement, but, ultimately, this has never fully replaced the need for Congress to act, and my hope is, is that after a number of the other issues that we're working on currently get cleared, that there is some quiet conversations start up -- back up again, particular, in the Republican party, about the shortsighted approach that they're taking when it comes to immigration. Okay. Christi Parsons."", 'Thank you, Mr. President. More than six million Americans may soon lose health insurance if the Supreme Court does not fast the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act.', 'Uh-huh.', 'A growing number of states are looking for assistance as they face the prospect that their residents may lose federal insurance subsidies and their insurance markets may collapse. Yet, your administration has given very little to no guidance on how states can prepare. What can you tell state leaders and advocates who worry that healthcare markets in half the country may be thrown into chaos?', ""What I can tell state leaders is, is that under well-established precedent, there is no reason why the existing exchanges should be overturned through a court case. It has been well documented that those who passed this legislation never intended for folks who were going through the federal exchange not to have their citizens get subsidies. That's not just the opinion of me. That's not just the opinion of Democrats. It's the opinion of the Republicans who worked on the legislation. The record makes it clear, and under well-established statutory interpretation, approaches that have been repeatedly employed, not just by liberal democratic judges, but by conservative judges like some on the current Supreme Court, you interpret a statute based on what the intent and meaning and the overall structure the statute provides for, and so this should be an easy case. Frankly, it probably shouldn't have even been taken up, and, you know, since we're going to get a ruling pretty quick, I think it's important for us to go ahead and assume that the Supreme Court is going to do what most legal scholars who have looked at this would expect them to do, but, look, I've said before, and I will repeat again. If, in fact, you have a contorted reading of the statute that says federal-run exchanges don't provide subsidies for folks who are participating in those exchanges, then that throws off how that exchange operates. It means that millions of people who are obtaining insurance currently with subsidies suddenly aren't getting those subsidies, many of them can't afford it. They pull out, and the assumptions that the insurance companies made when they priced their insurance suddenly gets thrown out the window, and it would be disruptive, not just, by the way, for folks in the exchanges, but for those insurance markets in most states generally, so it's a bad idea. It's not something that should be done based on a twisted interpretation of four words in -- as we were reminded repeatedly -- a couple-thousand-page piece of legislation. What's more, the thing is working. I mean, what -- part of what's bizarre about this whole thing is, we haven't had a lot of conversation about the horrors of Obamacare because none of them come [sic] to pass. You got 16 million people who's gotten health insurance. The overwhelming majority of them are satisfied with the health insurance. It hasn't had an adverse effect on people who already had their health insurance. The only effect it's had on people who already had health insurance is they now have an assurance that they won't be prevented from getting health insurance if they've got a pre-existing condition, and they've get additional protections with the health insurance that they do have. The costs have come in substantially lower than even our estimates about how much it would cost. Healthcare inflation overall, has continued to be at some of the lowest levels in 50 years. None of the predictions about how this wouldn't work have come to pass, and so, I'm -- A -- I'm optimistic that the Supreme Court will, you know, play it straight when it comes to an interpretation, and, B, I should mention, that if it didn't, Congress could fix this whole thing with a one-sentence provision, so --"", ""You're --"", ""But I'm not going to go into a long speculation anticipating disaster."", ""But you're a plan-ahead kind of guy. Why not have a plan B?"", ""Well, you know, I want to just make sure that everybody understands that you have a model that it -- where all the pieces connect, and, I mean, there are a whole bunch of scenarios not just for the -- in relation to healthcare, but all kinds of stuff that I do where if somebody does something that doesn't make any sense, then it's hard to fix, and then this would be hard to fix. Fortunately, there's no reason to have to do it. It doesn't need fixing. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you, to the people of Germany and Bavaria. You guys were wonderful hosts."", ""All right. So there he is, the President of the United States wrapping up a news conference with an extensive opening statement, but answering several questions, several reporters asking two or three questions as part of one question. Most of the questions revolving on Iraq and ISIS, Russia and Putin, healthcare, as you just heard. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. I want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. Let's get some analysis on what we just heard, Jake Tapper. You're here with me, Jake. Let's talk about Iraq and ISIS. The president is saying he's still waiting for a plan from the Pentagon on training and arming the Iraqi military to go ahead and fight"", ""That's right. He said that they don't have a complete strategy as of right now, but they're looking for one from the Pentagon when it comes to getting the Iraqi forces trained more quickly, equipped. They're waiting for information from the Iraqis. Presumably, that's one of the things that he and Prime Minister Al-Abadi will discuss, so that was one of the works in progress that he discussed. He also, Wolf, talked about Ukraine, and he held out the threat of further sanctions. He said very specifically that there was a lot of discussion about making sure that Russia and Ukraine uphold their commitments made in the Minsk Agreements in March, and then he said there was also discussion about additional steps should Russia double down on the aggression, not just directly by Russians, but by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, so those were two things where, clearly, there's a lot of discussion about trying to get prepared for the future. Where he would not engage about preparing for the future was about whether or not the Supreme Court decides that the state exchanges are contrary to the Obamacare law. He said it was a bad idea, not something that should be done based on a twisted interpretation of four words in a several thousand-page law, but he would not answer Christi Parsons, the reporter from the Chicago Tribune, her questions about what will be the plan B? What's should the states, the governors, advocates do if, in fact, millions of individuals who have health insurance through Obamacare on these state exchanges are suddenly no longer allowed to use state exchanges because the Supreme Court Says they're contrary to the law?"", ""And the Supreme Court makes -- supposed to make a decision between now and the end of this month, so in the coming days, we'll hear from the Supreme Court. Obviously, a very, very important decision from the US Supreme Court. Jim Acosta is traveling with the president. He's joining us right now. And, well, actually, we don't have Jim Acosta, Jim Sciutto. We do have Jim Sciutto. Jim, what did you hear from the president as far as Iraq is concerned? Because we clearly heard him giving at least some indirect lecturing to the prime minister, Haider Al-Abadi, who was there with him in Germany today, yeah, some indirect lecturing. You've got to get your act together. You've got to work not only with Iraqi Shia, but also the Sunnis and the Kurds."", ""He does. But at the same time, we also heard some acknowledgments, admissions, from the president on where the current strategy isn't working. He said that -- about ISIS. If they're displaced in one place, they show up in another place, kind of this whack-a-mole phenomenon that you've seen where you might have had a victory, for instance, in Tikrit, but then a few weeks later, you have ISIS take over Ramadi. Baiji has been handed back and forth between Iraqi and ISIS forces, and the president acknowledging that the foreign fighter flow continuing despite a great effort by a number of nations involved. The president is saying that even though, in his words, we're taking a lot of them out, they're being replenished, and that doesn't solve the problem in the long-term. Those are two fairly significant admissions there, that they haven't stopped the foreign fighter flow, so all that body count talk that we had last week really irrelevant because even if you kill 10,000 or 13,000 and they're being replenished, what's the actual effect on the battle field? We haven't seen it. But also in terms of territory, that if you win somewhere, the coalition, they come back somewhere else, and that's a real problem, and as you and Jake noted, to say -- the president to say, really, the onerous is on Iraqi forces to fight them on the ground, but the US is still figuring out how it's going to help those Iraqi forces, and, as you note, Wolf, this old issue that's been there for a long time, that, that government in Baghdad isn't seen as representing the whole country, particularly, the Sunnis. That's an old problem. That's been around for years. If that hasn't been addressed, it raises real questions about how quickly you're going to be able to change that dynamic on the battlefield no matter how many more Iraqi forces you train or how many more weapons, anti-tank weapons, et cetera, that you send them there. It's a real problem. It's a real question about the effectiveness of the current White House strategy."", ""And there -- as we said, the president did make it clear. He's waiting for a plan from the Pentagon to continue arming and training these Iraqi military. He says, once they're armed and trained, they'll -- presumably, they'll do a better job fighting ISIS, so we'll see about that. Jim Acosta is with us now. He's joining us from the scene. Jim, what's stood out from your mind? You've been covering the president now for a long time. You're there with him on the ground."", ""Well, Wolf, as we were saying earlier, this is a G7 Summit without a lot of substance, and, unfortunately, I think the president added some substance inadvertently, not only with his awkward photo op earlier in the day, but this awkward phraseology of saying we don't have a complete strategy for training the Iraqi security forces. Of course, he was talking about in a larger context, this plan that he's hoping to receive from the Pentagon shortly that will expand that training, expand that arming, so they can take the fight to ISIS, but in this day and age, Wolf, when a fraction of a statement can be pulled out of context, magnified, and Tweeted, the president is going to have a problem on his hands, and he's going to have a problem on his hands with what he just said at that news conference with respect to the battle against ISIS. Now, at the same time, you know, you heard the president say during this news conference, really praising Haider Al-Abadi, saying that he is trying to overcome some of these problems that he inherited from his predecessor who was not uniting the country, who was really waging sort of a one-religion government in terms of the Shia Muslims in that country, and so that Haider Al-Abadi is trying to pick up the pieces from that, and the president is trying to give him some time, but, Wolf, when I talked to senior administration officials inside the white house at just about every level, they say time and again, this president is not going to go against his original mandate and put US combat troops on the ground, and when it comes to turning around this fight against ISIS, it appears that there really is no other alternative than to do that. You can wait years and years for the Iraqi security forces to be able to do this fight, but unless there are US combat troops on the ground in massive numbers, it's really hard to see how ISIS is going to be quickly defeated, and that is why you hear the president on down preparing -- trying to prepare the American People, though they don't say it publicly very often, that this fight, this war is going to take a very, very long time, Wolf."", ""And I just want to be precise. We have to take a quick break, but what the president did say, he said, when a finalized plan is presented to me by the Pentagon, then I will share it with the American People. It's not -- we don't yet have a complete strategy because it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis, and then he went onto explain. Let's take a quick break. We'll have much more right after this."", ""Well, you've been watching CNN's coverage of President Obama's speech at the G7 Summit. I'm Robyn Curnow. I'm coming to you from Trinidad and Tobago, the unlikely center of much of the focus of that investigation into corruption in world football and all centered around one man, Jack Warner. We've been following him and the developments here on the ground, and you'll have more of our reports and updates throughout the day. In the meantime, though, I want to bring you up-to-date on other news that making headlines here at CNN. I want to take you to Sicily now, where as many as 1200 rescued migrants have just arrived. A British Navy ship picked them up in the Mediterranean over the weekend. British Red Cross workers are now attending to them. There (inaudible) maybe 6000 people who became stranded while sailing from North Africa to Europe over the past few days. Several European Navies helped rescue the others. Many of them, of course, are fleeing conflict, poverty in Africa and the Middle East. Improved weather and calmer seas are causing a new wave of migrants to attempt that dangerous crossing. Well, let's turn to Iraq now where pro- government forces are just one step closer to retaking the country's largest oil refinery from ISIS. Military officials are telling CNN ISIS fighters have been pushed out of the City of Baiji. US-led coalition air strikes helped support that operation. ISIS militants left booby traps, we understand, in the city before fleeing north to Mosul. They're still in control of the Baiji Refinery, but joint Iraqi forces are better positioned to surround them. Also an update on the status of Jason Rezaian, that Washington Post journalist. Iran's state news agency says the second session of the trial against him has now ended. The closed-door proceedings began earlier today. Now, if you remember, Rezaian, has been in custody in Iran since July. The Iranian/America will have another court session, we understand, but no date has been given. Now, some of the charges against him include cooperating with hostile governments and propaganda against the regime. The US and the Washington Post and many journalists around the world have been calling for his release. Let's also now go to Turkey, bring you an update on that landmark parliamentary election that can be summed up in two words, fear and hope. Fear that president Recep Tayyip Erdogan would try to win sweeping new powers, appears to be -- motivated many voters to go to the polls, but there's hope, too, that the results would shape, reshape, Turkey's future. Well, as our Arwa Damon now explains, that's just what happened."", ""80-year-old Gula (ph) Doldumager (ph) has voted in every election since she turned 18. In her lifetime, she has seen how unforgiving political, and by default, economic, instability here can be. Everything has its importance, she says. We've been through some eras. Every passing day has its significance, and this most certainly among them. Not matter what the outcome of this parliamentary election was going to significantly shape the country's future, and it has. An end to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's single-party rule, his justice and development party, the AKP, fell short of the needed 276 seats, and will have to, for the first time since they came to power in 2002, form a coalition, or according to some analysts, even call for early parliamentary elections. Throughout the voting stations we visited, there was a sense of unease. In some areas, people easily aggravated as we witnessed here at a poling station in one of Istanbul's conservative neighborhoods, where the AKP enjoys a solid support base. Despite the fact that regulations clearly state that as media, we are allowed into poling stations as long as we're not impeding on individuals' ability to vote, we were just asked to leave the premises here. A sizable argument ended up breaking out after those local authorities in the building were unclear as to whether or not we should be allowed to film, illustrating just how tense the situation here potentially is. Contributing to that was the fate of the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party, the HDP, attempting for the first time to enter parliament as a party and to achieve that having to cross a 10 percent national threshold. They succeeded and made history. These results are the triumph of freedom in the face of oppression, and of peace in the face of war, (inaudible) earned that, HDP parliamentarian declared. A key factor that drove up the HDP votes was fear of what the AKP would do if it gained enough seats to unilaterally overhaul the constitution and implement a presidential system that could potentially see Erdogan in power indefinitely. And the HDP, a traditionally pro-Kurdish party, has grown into a more inclusive entity. No longer alienating Turkey's traditional secularists. 24-year-old Yamur Yanaz does not have Kurdish roots, nor does she view the HDP as being a uniquely Kurdish party. She believes that the HDP will work to safeguard human and women's rights."", ""There is a change going on and that's really exciting for me, for everyone really."", 'But change here is never easy, and rarely smooth.

We'll tell you more about him in just a few minutes, but, first, we want to focus on the nine people whose lives were brutally cut short. Well, the victims of the shooting had gathered at the Emanuel AME church to study the Bible. They were a small group including the pastor and other staff members, and the gunman sat among them for an hour before opening fire.

There is been an out pouring of grief and also words of sympathy and comfort for the victims, for the victims' families and for the entire community, and it's really been a multi-racial coming together. Last night there was a prayer service at a church just behind Emanuel AME, which you can see behind me. You can see across the street, there is a makeshift memorial that has been growing, flowers and signs. Last night, several Presbyterian churches came together, black and white together to offer words of comfort and sympathy to each other. There was also a candlelight vigil.

Of the 13 people inside Emanuel AME Church that night, only three survived. One did so by playing dead.

The city of Charleston, South Carolina, is sending a message of unity days after a massacre meant to ignite divisions. Thousands of people march across the Charleston Bridge in honor of the nine people shot and killed Wednesday at Emanuel AME Church. We're told the shooter wanted to start a race war. Instead, the community has been gathering in solidarity. Well, investigators are now taking a look at a racist manifesto that appeared on a website registered to the confessed gunman, Dylann Roof. The text details a philosophy of white superiority. Roof is also seen in several photos holding a gun and holding the Confederate battle flag. Well, that flag is still flying high on the grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol. Protesters rallied in Columbia over the weekend demanding it be taken down. The flag was used by the South during the American civil war. Some say it's a part of their heritage. For others, it's a symbol of racism that has no place on state grounds. Republican State representative in South Carolina told CNN, he plans to propose legislation to remove it."", ""We're talking about a flag that hangs on state ground, on land owned by the people of this state, and in my opinion, if even one South Carolinian, finds it to be offensive, it shouldn't be on state land. It should not be on the land where progress is supposed to take place, but, yet, with that symbol, we're actually backing up."", ""Well, taking the flag down won't be easy. It requires the support of two-thirds of lawmakers in a state where there's long been fierce support for the symbol. The shooting in Charleston, along with recent high-profile cases involving the deaths of black men have raised the question at how prominent racism still is right here in the United States. President Barack Obama is now saying it's very much alive during an interview released today, he made his point using language many may consider offensive."", ""The legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives, you know, that casts a long shadow, and that's still part of our DNA that's passed on. It -- we're not cured of it."", 'Racism.', 'Racism, we are not cured of it.', 'Clearly.', ""And it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public. That's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It's not just a matter of overt discrimination. We have -- societies don't, overnight, completely erase everything that happened two to three hundred years prior."", ""Well, CNN political reporter M.J. Lee joins us now from New York. M.J., good to have you with us. You know, for a lot of people, you know, it's raising eyebrows why the president was, you know, decide to cross a red line to many and go there and use in kind of language. What are we hearing from the White House in terms of an explanation for the president's decision to use that word?"", ""Sure. As you know, President Obama is famous for being sort of this cool-headed, level-headed, you know, in public not showing a lot of emotions kind of a president, so I think it's been all the more striking to see his response to the shooting in South Carolina. When he first made his remarks, you could tell that he was visibly angry. He was frustrated. He said, you know, I've had to make statements like this after mass shooting too many times as president, and I think the administration and the White House, especially, as the president looks towards the end of his presidency, is not afraid to go there. He wants to make the case that this, in his opinion, is unacceptable that he is angry that our Congress here in the US has not taken action to do something about gun control, and I think it's a message that we are going to hear more and more from him; especially, as the national dialog here has been really focused on racial tensions, on police brutality, especially against African-Americans."", ""M.J., context is important. Explain to our viewers who the president was speaking to. What was the context of the interview. Who was the context of the interviewer? Who was the interviewer that he made these comments to. Sure. This was a radio interview. He was talking broadly, and this was not just an interview about what happened in South Carolina, but, of course, I think because of the timing and because it happened just a couple of days ago. This is really the news event that has really captured the nation, and I think it's important to understand, as you said, the context of his comments. He wasn't saying that the country has not come a long way since, you know, he himself was born to a white mother and a black father. He was actually making the case that the country has made enormous progress since, you know, in the last 30, 40 years, but his point was, just because we don't hear offensive words like the N-word, we don't hear that a lot in public, does not mean that, you know, racial tensions are not really embedded into the fabric of this country still. So the question is where did the conversation go from here? You know, the president has crossed, well, many will consider it to be a line, and used this language. Even if it is to make a point, some would say it's still crossing the line. Where does the conversation about racism go now? Where does the White House take that conversation?"", ""Sure. I mean, I think the president's frustration with Congress whether it can do something on gun control is real. It's really represents the fact that it's really difficult at this day and age to get something done on gun control. He mentioned the NRA's powerful presence in this country. Its lobbying efforts are really strong, and I think a lot of public officials really have to contend with that. I think it's been interesting to see that 2016 presidential candidates have to grapple with this question, of, well, what about the Confederate flag that flies in South Carolina? Should that be taken down, and a lot of the Republican candidates have really said, well, this is not for us to weight into. This is not a debate for us to decide. This is for South Carolina to decide. I think, other than former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the candidates have been really reticent to really weight into this extremely complicated and complex issue."", 'Yeah. M.J. Lee joining us there from New York. Really appreciate the insight. Thanks so much.', 'Thanks.', 'Well, scorching heat kills more than 100 people in Pakistan, and power outages in Ramadan fasting are only making things worse.

So mainly, it took the others to speed up court case is where there's been a huge overhaul and slowing things down and also has approved an EU directive that's bolstering banks and protecting savers with deposits under 100,000 euros. And these were both two steps that were seen by the creditors as essential, simply to begin the next round of bailout talks that are now set to begin tomorrow. So as mentioned earlier, they seemed to have cleared those first initial hurdles for these talks to begin and these are seen as very important steps to getting negotiations started at possibly wrapping them up by the 20th of August when Greece has to make it's next big payment to the European Central Bank."", ""So that is the next crisis point we're looking towards August 20. How likely is it that these sides are going to come to terms on a bailout agreement or could be back-- could we be back at the same situation that we were just a couple weeks ago?"", ""Well it all depends on how this is done. From what we understand, the next vote that we have, the next agreement that we have will be a more general agreement. They will go through specifics but it will be a vote on the overall agreement rather than specific measures because what we saw in the parliament in the last two weeks is that when it comes down to specifics, there are a lot of - there are a lot of people in - within Mr. Tsipras' party and itself, a lot of parliamentarians that oppose these specific measures. And yesterday's vote was an indication of that. He got very close to the threshold minority, the 120 which is as many as it needs to be able to hold a minority government. I mean, he did get the over all support. He got the support of 230 MP's but in that vote, 36 voted no or abstained. So that's a very big number for such a new party and at such a crucial time. So there's a lot of question on whether cities will be able to hold together."", ""And Tsipras remains popular at least for now. There's like going back on pretty much every election promise that he made. He said he will not resign but clearly, this could change very quickly once those austerity measures really begin to bite."", ""Well, this is partly the concern. That's the big concern for the Prime Minister himself. So just yesterday, he actually urged his own MPs to vote and support. He asked them to stop hiding behind his signature and if they have a better plan, to basically just come out and say it. And this was his way of stopping all these rumors and all these attacks that he's been receiving from his own party and saying you know, if we're going to do this, we have to stay in this together. There is a big party congress coming out in early September and I think if we don't see any clarifications, if we don't see that solidarity before then, we could be looking at changes at that congress."", 'More turmoil ahead, no doubt.

As Kim Jong-Un a locomotive complex recently, North Korea's government news agency reports his younger sister Kim Yo-Jong was with him. She's 27 years old, increasingly seen as a rising star. Said to be Kim's closest adviser. Kim Yo-Jong is believed to be taking on key roles in her brother's security agencies gaining huge influence over who gets appointed to top post. And that's not all."", 'Kim Yo-Jong supposedly now has her fingers on the royal economy where money that is coming directly into the Kim family.', ""That's not only black market currency, cigarettes and medicines. But legitimate business like building statues in Africa according to analysts. They say Kim Yo-Jong's influence is becoming more like that of their aunt, Kim Kyung-Hui, sister of their late father, Kim Jung-Il. Kim Kyung-Hui had enormous power until Kim Jung- Un turned on her husband Jang Sung-Taek and had him executed in 2013. Now, it falls to Kim Jung-Un's younger sister to help him navigate the dangerous halls of power in Pyongyang."", ""He is a person that Kim Jung-Un would reach out to and expects to have his back inside the blood sport that's politics inside the regime."", ""But because she's so young, Kim Yo-Jong likely needs her own protector. Analyst Ken Gause says that's likely the role of another shadowy older sister, Kim Sol Song. She is the purest of the pure, Gause says, because she's the only one among Kim and his siblings ever officially recognized by their grandfather, North Korea's founder Kim Il-Sung. Kim Sol Song is said to possibly been mentoring her younger siblings, helping them build relationships and sever their ties to their father's old cronies."", ""Kim Jung-Un cannot afford to have any kind of swing to his loyalty by those that might automatically look to the older, more experienced leaders of he past. He's clearly much more young and robust than his decrepit 80-year old generals. And so Kim Jung-Un has to make sure that they look to him for leadership and not his elders."", ""Who's the target of Kim Jung-Un's deadly purges? A U.S. official tells us, he's focusing on replacing top military figures. But analysts say he's got to tread carefully and not create too many enemies along the way.

Danny, let me start with you because we're seeing Freddie Gray made that short list of the top legal stories of the year, and this happens to be one of the cases that you really kept watch on."", 'Definitely. Freddie Gray, and really all of the police force cases, in just the last year alone, have caused us all to re-evaluate the way that police force cases are evaluated and prosecuted, not just from the county to county, but from state to federal court. Freddie Gray was also interesting because it educates citizens about the very minimum quantum of evidence that is needed to have a police to initiate the stop. That was similar with the Sandra Bland case. What was the minimal amount of evidence that police need to invade your space and detain you to conduct an investigation? Because once they get to that point, they can pretty easily start hopscotching from there to an arrest.', 'Do you think average Americans are actually learning from the legal cases of what to do and what not to do?', 'I hope so. And maybe not so much what to do, but there is not a downside to the citizens becoming educated about not only their legal rights but police procedure. And when you have that knowledge, good or bad, it overall is a good thing for the citizenry. I mean, that plus the Internet, plus media coverage of it, it makes citizens more about police encounters. And that is always a good thing.', 'Always a good thing, Alison. And just to piggyback of that, and I do agree, Dan -- I mean, it is so important what happened with Freddie Gray and the police cases, but I say comply now and grieve later. No matter what your grievances on the street, Alison, comply with the officers and at some later, go to court, get a good lawyer, do what you have to do. But my big story, Alison, was Bill Cosby.', 'And why is that?', ""You know, I say that because it touch so many people's lives, in terms of women, women who comes such a long way, as far as sexual harassment, the things that you're always taught growing up in terms of respecting women, we would not be here if it weren't for women, moms -- mom, love you -- you know, everyone, you know, wife, I love you, too. You know, but the fact is, is that, you know, it is just affecting so many people, and not to say that he is guilty of anything, because it is not going to court, and, you know, in that way, in a criminal way, but just the sheer impact, and what it has on all of the notions of who Cosby is, and recognizing that he is not criminally convicted of anything, I get it. But the sheer accusations of 50 women or more has just affected so many people, and affected me in an impactful way."", ""And to piggyback off of what Joey said, he's absolutely right, the Cosby case is also what caused us in a more broad sense to reevaluate things like the statute of limitations for sexual abuse cases, and that is about line drawing. How do we as a society, when do we draw the line and say, well, something decades' old, maybe the evidence is too stale to persecute, or in the case of sexual assault or rape, there should be no statutes of limitations? And this is an issue that we are grappling with even today in the legislatures."", 'And interestingly enough, the book not necessarily closed on them, because they will be going into the next year.', ""So true, Alison. Freddie Gray and Bill Cosby, based upon the lawsuits now. He is suing with the defamation of character, they're suing saying he defamed them."", 'They may continue to be your top legal stories in 2016, for bad or good.', 'Probably will.', 'Could be.', 'All right. Thanks for coming on today. We\'ll talk to you later on the show. Up next, before he was ""Ironman"", Robert Downey Jr. was a convicted felon, but thanks to the Christmas gift from the California governor, he is off of the naughty list for good.', 'Robert Downey Jr. has an extra reason to celebrate this holiday season, because yesterday, the California governor granted the ""Ironman"" actor a full and conditional pardon for his 1996 conviction on drug and weapons charges. His sentence included almost four years of prison time, and probation. Governor Jerry Brown says Downey has paid his debt to society, and is served his time, and quote, ""since the release from custody, he has lived an honest, and upright life, exhibited morale character, and conducted himself as a law-abiding citizen."" Let\'s go ahead and bring back CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos and HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson. So, Joey, Robert Downey, Jr., one of 91 people, you\'re giving him a congratulatory clap here, one of 91 people Governor Brown pardoned. He was a convicted felon, and a convicted felon as such, you lose certain rights.', 'You do.', 'You lose the right to vote, to own a gun. Are these rights going to be reinstated for Robert Downey?', ""You know what, well, this is what happens. First, let's approach broadly, Alison, and broadly speaking, the reason I'm clapping because here's our system is about -- it's about punishment, and deterrence, but also rehabilitation."", 'Redemption, Joey.', ""Absolutely. And when someone demonstrates that they have got -- look, they have done something terribly wrong to society, and after that, they've led a law-abiding reward, there has to be some reward for keeping straight and narrow. I think society benefits so greatly by that. Now, whenever there is a pardon by the federal government or in the federal case, by the president, what happens is, rights are restored. But then we get into the rights that you mentioned in terms of voting, owning a firearm, employment rights, and that type of thing. But then, of course, you consult the counsel, same lawyer presumably to get the record expunged or sealed, because that's what's very important. Now, there's a distinction between expunging and --"", 'Can Robert Downey Jr. have his record wiped clean now?', ""Right. So, under the federal law, first, yes, if you get a pardon, yes, you can vote, yes, you can own a firearm. But the expungement laws vary from state to state. And commonly, Joey and I get this phone call and people will say, hey, I have two armed robberies convicted five years ago, can I get those expunged? And the answer is usually no. For the most part, expungement is a cleaning up of not only your criminal record, but even your arrest record. However, that is usually only permissible if you were not convicted. If you have been convicted for the most part, your only option is going to be a pardon. And a pardon is not so much the striking of the record, but as much as executive forgiveness. It's the governor or the chief executive, which will be the president or the governor saying, yes, you committed a crime, yes, you were convicted, but you seem like a nice guy, and we're going to forgive it. It's still -- you were still convicted of that crime. But many of those civil abilities, like the inability to own a gun, some of the other things we're talking about, they become lifted and restored."", 'OK. So here in my hand are a list of 95 people a week ago President Obama granted commutations and pardons. First of all, how does he choose and who is going to be the benefit of this?', ""Alison, that is really the question. For all we know, it could be one of the magic 8 balls. Who knows who and why and how executives choose to grant pardons? In the past, many have been accused of favoritism, cronyism. It really -- we hope that it's a merit-based analysis, but we really don't know. It really depends on the strength of their petition."", 'All right. Well, I will give a little clap to Robert Downey Jr. anyway.', 'Good job, Robert.', 'All right. Thanks for joining us. I love that. Merry Christmas.', 'There he is.', 'And that is for all of you who have been rehabilitated and pardoned, keep up the good work. Society needs the people to get back on the straight and narrow, and we are all benefit as a result of that. And so, to the governor of California, kudos to you. And, Mr. President, kudos to you, too.', ""All right. thanks for coming on today. Merry Christmas. And up next, home for Christmas takes on a whole new meaning when it's coming home from war.

President Obama is expected to announce executive action on gun control and the President has expressed frustration many, many times over the course of his presidency about the inability of congress to pass comprehensive gun legislation. Does this get it done? And if not, what needs to happen? Here to discuss is Senior Advisor to the President Obama, Valerie Jarrett. Miss Jarrett, happy New Year to you. I want to remind people of one of the moments that really encapsulates the President\'s frustration and desire to do more about this that happened after the Sandy Hook massacre. Let\'s remember, everybody, where we all were at that time is felt through the President.', 'The majority, those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10 years old.', 'The pain real for the President, real for those families, real for the entire country as we all looked on. The question is, will what is happening today stop the next Sandy Hook and it seems to be that the answer is no but what is the case for these executive orders?', ""Well, good morning, Chris. Yes, you took us back to the most painful day in the President's term in office. And what we're trying to do today is to take very important steps that will keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. So background checks, simple background checks making sure that it doesn't matter where you sell the gun. What happens is if you're here in the business of selling a gun then you should register and you should ensure that people have background checks. We want to keep our communities safe. What we can -- What can we do to improve our system of data collection, of investigations, of enforcing the laws? What can we do to invest in mental health? The President is proposing $500 million to help with mental health services and ensuring that the social security administration is providing data to the folks to do the background checks for people who have mental illnesses and who are threat to themselves or the others. Now what can we do to make our guns smarter? We have smart phones. You can, you know, touch with a fingerprint to make sure that they're in the right hands. We know that so many people are killed each year, 30,000 people are killed each year, two-thirds by suicide. Let's make sure that our guns are smart and only the people who are supposed to have them, have them. So many children have access to guns and are accidentally shooting others. So let's invest in new technology and ensure that our guns are smart too. So there's a whole host of steps the President is going to take today. But ultimately, the best solution would be for congress to act. He called on congress to act after the Sandy Hook massacre. There has been a lot of pressure that's been put on them by 90 percent of the American people who support sensible steps to be taken. But the President is determined that he's going to do whatever is within his power to keep guns out of the wrong hands."", ""You could argue that taking these executive steps is going to make anything done with congress more difficult though, couldn't you miss, Jarrett, because executive orders frustrate the Republicans, feeds this narrative that the President goes alone, because he doesn't like to work with others. And then you get on to the practical realities of you don't stop these mass shootings all by dealing with gun shows. We never traced back any of these weapons to that. Yes, the mental health is a component but most of the problem is inner-city crime. Most of the problem is illegal handguns in the wrong hands. So how do you balance these two? How to get it done politically with what the real problem is to begin with?"", ""Well, first of all, we do know that a lot of deaths from gun violence have today because guns are in the wrong hands, I mean I'll give you good examples. Look at the State of Connecticut. They passed important background checks and also required training. Their gun deaths went down by 40 percent, compare that to Missouri that got rid of their background checks and loosened up their regulations and their gun deaths went up by 50 percent above the national average. Those are two good examples of where background checks to make a very big difference and save lives."", ""So, the question becomes how do you get it done? And as you acknowledge just from, you know, point of law is that an executive order can only go with an existing legislation. You need to have more legislation or at least better executive, not executive but enforcement capabilities with these. So you need congress. Why can't the President get congress and work with them on something that everybody seems to agree needs to be done?"", ""Well, obviously the President made a very strong effort to work with congress and 90 percent of the American people supported what he was doing. Ninety percent of the Democrats in congress supported it. We just had a hard time getting the Republicans to take what everybody believes are sensible steps. The fact of the matter is that the President has said, the American people are going to -- are getting energized about this issue. It's becoming more passionate. We're seeing a lot of activity in cities and states across the country who were taking steps and ultimately that's going to put congress under pressure to do the right thing."", ""But why not go at it again? You know, I mean if it's matters that much to the President, why not make it an open process, approach them, have the meeting or play the game the way it's always been played in points of compromise? If it's that important, why not reapproach as opposed to circumventing and really just hardening their resistance with the President."", ""Well, let's be specific. The President isn't circumventing congress. He is doing what is clearly within his authority to do. He would -- He is doing as well within the existing statute. He's trying to make sure that he does everything within his power to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Congress has the responsibility for acting. We welcome the opportunity to work with them to pass legislation. But they made it very clear that they don't intend to act. And so in their absence of action, we're going to do what we can do. But be clear, Chris, the door is always open for us to engage with them and work on what we can do to make America safer."", ""Now they say, and obviously you can't generalize, but we have many sources on the other side of the aisle who say that's not true. He wants to front load all these stuff with provisions that won't do anything, like magazine, size, and banning certain weapons and not others, and that they don't want to start there. But they do want to start with some of these more basic provisions about where checks are, money for enforcement, money for mental health, record sharing and that certainly goes to the mass shooting to deal with money to enable harsher sentences for those who used guns in commissions of a crime. As you know, many states say we don't have the money to keep people with these long sentences. Why not get that part done if they say they want to work them?"", ""Well, so -- Well, so for example, what the President is proposing today and what will be in his budget that he'll be proposing to congress is we do need to have additional resources for ATF to go after those who are selling guns who shouldn't be selling them without a license. And so, we are -- we have in the budget additional 200 ATF agents so that we can beef up our enforcement. The President is increasing the number of people who are working in the background check area. We're improving the technology there. We're improving the data collection. The attorney general is calling on governors to make sure that we're getting the data from the states that we need to ensure that the background check information is as sufficient as it could be. So there's a lot that we can do within the executive branch that we are doing. But again, Chris, we welcome that opportunity to work with congress on a whole host of issues. They've made mental health a big issue. And so, that's why the President is proposing his budget to half a billion dollars to totally improve our mental health services. So there is lots of room for working with congress. And we're -- they are important to the successful implementation of what the President is proposing today."", ""And we look forward to seeing how the President does make this approach of introducing these orders today. It'll be interesting to see if it's an invitation to more with congress. Valerie Jarrett, thank you very much for coming on to argue the President's case."", 'Thank you. Thank you, Chris.', ""Appreciate it. All right. So what do you think? You heard the basic line of why the President is doing this versus going the congressional route. What they think will make a difference in the number of crimes we have involving guns. What do you think? Tweet us @NewDay or post your comment on facebook.com/NewDay. And, again, it is worth reminding you, this issue matters that's why CNN is taking it very seriously. The President has responded to an invitation from Anderson Cooper to do an exclusive Live Town Hall event on Guns In America. The President will make the case to you as to why executive action and specifically these are what he needed to do right now. He will take live questions from the studio audience and from around the country. So remember, Town Hall on Guns, moderated by our man, Anderson Cooper, this Thursday night, 8:00 p.m., only on CNN, of course. Mich."", ""All right. Chris, former President Bill Clinton back on the campaign trail to support his wife. Hillary calls him her not-so secret weapon. Could his help actually backfire or will it help? We'll take a look."", 'Bill Clinton is making his first solo appearances on the trail this week, stumping for Hillary Clinton. The question is will he help? Will he hurt Hillary? John Avalon is our CNN Political Analyst and the Editor in Chief at The Daily Beast. Pleased, good to have you here.', 'Good morning.', ""So let's talk Bill Clinton. He overall -- There is no rule. He's good, he's bad. There's a bit of both. It's a mixed bag."", ""He's a man in full. Good, bad and the ugly is what you get but Bubba is back on the trail. And the important thing to remember, there is no political talent quite like Bill Clinton."", ""Now that's a very good way of saying that. Let's take a look back in terms of some of the weaknesses. We go back to 1998 just before he was impeached."", 'Well, I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong.', 'It seems tough to start there. He was dogged to jury about this scandal during his presidency, accused for sexual harassment several times over the years. Mr. Trump in fact has said he is a great woman abuser, whatever that means, how badly does that affect the woman who would be the first president of the United States if her dreams come true?', ""Yes, it is a significant baggage. I mean that's the bad and the ugly of Bill Clinton and it's obviously a stain on the history of his presidency being the second president impeached. And it makes it difficult for Hillary to be the full feminist icon that she hopes to surf that wave of emotion and support into the presidency. So that is definitely the baggage that exists. The question is how much is that baked in the cake already? How much do people know it and how much does bringing it up make from the Republicans looks small and petty, and obsessed with the past as opposed to the future?"", ""We'll take a look at the 2008 election. I had a little bit of trouble with outburst after some frustrating finishes, he started going negative on then Senator Barack Obama."", ""Said in 2004 there was no difference between you and George Bush on the war. And you took that speech you're now running on off your website. Give me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen."", ""He also said that Obama's campaign came after Hillary with the race card. Does that impulsiveness post any risk?"", 'Look, part of being the kind of high-wire act that is Bill Clinton on the trail was it sometimes you cross over that line.', 'Yeah.', ""He is fighting for his wife's campaign in a tough-fought campaign there. But that left really divisive marks inside the Democratic Party at that particular point."", ""OK. Let's take a look at how ever him describing Mitt Romney. This is May 2012."", ""He had a good business career. There is no question that in terms of getting up and going to the office and you know, basically performing the essential functions of the office. A man who's been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold but they have dramatically different proposals."", 'Was that necessarily a bad thing?', ""Well, so this one exactly against what the DNC was pushing against Mitt Romney at that time that they were sort of vulture capitalism. And here's Bill Clinton committing a classic Washington gaffe which is telling the truth. Say now look, you may disagree with them but you know Mitt Romney is qualified to be president and had a successful record in business. That caused a lot of agitation inside the DNC during the 2012 re-election."", 'Despite of these things, as the -- the outburst, et cetera, you cannot deny that the man is a terrific political speaker. Here he is at the Democratic National Convention in 2012.', 'When President Barack Obama took office, the economy was in free fall. It had just shrunk nine full percent of GDP. We were losing 750,000 jobs a month. Are we doing better than that today? The answer is yes.', ""And then on the heels of that, here's President Obama himself speaking about him."", 'Romney e-mailed me after his speech. He said, you need to appoint him Secretary of Explaining Stuff.', 'So will that serve them on the trail list? The secretary of explaining --', 'The secretary of explaining stuff.', ""Thrown out there. You know what I mean? I don't know on the stump. That could be great."", ""It is. And it's an important part. Bill Clinton is able to talk about economics, talked about data, talked about policy in a way that really resonates with Populous. And that's such an important talent and it's one that is not given out equally. And so Bill Clinton's strength as a secretary of explaining stuff, and by the way, the original e-mail didn't say stuff."", 'Oh, OK.', 'That is a really important aspect of why he is such a powerful figure on the campaign trail that is campaigning for President Obama or his wife and obviously that popularity number.', 'Oh, OK. Can we just talk about this right here?', ""Yes, let's do that."", 'Wow, just wow. When the fact is that the man who used to be President is getting better favorability numbers than the woman who is wanting to be President, wow, just wow.', ""Wow, just wow. So the entire thing is sort of a surreal circumstance. We never had a former President running to be first laddie (ph), but this speaks to I think how popular Bill Clinton is. I mean this is a guy who left office with 60 percent approval rate. After being impeached politically he knows something the rest of us don't. And the fact he's been able to maintain that as the next president, that's not always a given. That shows that while he may be polarizing the Republicans, and he is, he remains deeply popular with the American people in polls."", ""First laddie, I don't know if that's going to stick though. Great to have you. Thank you so much for walking through those, those were great. Alisyn, over to you."", ""As though you two haven't given us enough entertainment, we have more.

CNN-276530,CONNECT THE WORLD,2016-02-14,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1602/14/ctw.01.html,,London Set to Host BAFTAs,"[""You're with CNN. This is Connect the World. I'm Becky Anderson. Welcome back. It's 52 minutes past 8:00 here in the UAE. American and British actors are getting ready in London as we speak for Britain's film awards Sunday evening. The film Peril, starring Kate Blanchett, and Stephen Speilberg's drama Bridge of Spies lead the night with nine nominations each. Now, this year's BAFTAs will be hosted by Stephen Fry at London's Royal opera house. And on the red carpet outside on what I would expect is a fairly chilly evening in London, but I may be wrong, CNN senior international correspondent Nima Elbagir is joining us live. It doesn't look as cold as it has been in -- on some of the occasions I've been hosting this event on the red carpet for CNN, as it were. Tell me, who have you met and what have you been hearing?"", ""Well, I would just like to point out that perhaps I am a good luck omen, Becky. Because it's not raining, for once. I know you had to brave the rain on more than one occasion. It is, however, remarkably cold. I'm just -- we had some of the earlier arrivals, none of the bold-faced names yet, but a lot of those ladies are not wearing coats. And I have so much pity for them. The night is going to be -- well, the night as it is -- it was hoped to be, has already been overshadowed, though, Becky, by the controversy that overshadowed much of this award season, fo course. The debate and the controversy over the lack of diversity. The BAFTA short-list is a little better than the Oscars, we have representation in the best supporting actor list with Idris Elba who is pushing ahead as a bit of hometown favorite. But some of those actors who are -- some of those black actors who are staging a silent protest the other side of the carpet from us, the other side of the barricades, they tell us that it's not just about the diversity of the short-list, Becky, it's about the diversity of the casting call itself and the need to have that diversity reflected on the big screens, the reality of the world that we live in reflected on the big screens. The hope for the BAFTA academy, of course, was that Sydney Poitier, Sir Sydney Poitier, as I should call him, would be here to receive his lifetime achievement award, but unfortunately his doctors have said that he won't be able to make that Transatlantic trip."", 'Britain has always had a groundbreaking film industry. And there were many people who thought to a certain extent -- you rightly point out some of the season has been overshadowed by this talk of a lack of diversity. And many thought perhaps this was an opportunity to put the Oscars to shame as it were with the BAFTAs just ahead of them. You are suggesting that you think that goes a bit too far, do you?', ""Well, We have heard Steven Fry, he was interviewed by our colleague Max Foster speaking out about this. And he went to great pains to really underplay this and say -- he called it, and this is a direct quote, pant wetting hysteria. So, on one level you've had actors themselves, like Idris Elba, speaking out very publicly, he spoke to the parliamentary select committee about the fact that diversity isn't just doing Britain as a society an injustice, but it is also costing Britain money. The reality that he and his fellow black actors have had to deal with, where as little opportunity as there is in America, he says that there is even less here for black actors, that often you have to cross the Atlantic to be recognized here back home. So, it will have been disappointing for many of them to hear Steven Fry really try and poo poo some very valid concerns. But everyone that we've been speaking to says it doesn't begin here, it begins at the casting calls. And that's where diversity, in a very real way, needs to start, Becky."", ""A very good point. All right. Well, enjoy the evening. I know it is cold. But you look marvelous. Nima Elbagir is on the red carpet for you this evening as the BAFTAs are set to kick off. Thank you, Nima. Well, your Parting Shots just before we go this evening. U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will be spending this Valentine's Day apart. But that didn't stop the pair from professing their love for each other. And they made it on to daytime TV. Have a look at this."", 'Somebody call the situation room because things are about to get hot.', 'Roses are red, violets are blue, you are the president and I am your boo.', ""I Obama care about you more than you even know.

You are watching CNN NEWSROOM. Good to have you with us. I'm George Howell. The headlines we're following --"", ""Republicans in the U.S. Senate are concerned about the vacancy in the U.S. Supreme Court following the death of Antonin Scalia. Many of them say they will not accept whoever President Obama nominates to replace the court's conservative icon. President Obama says he will name a nominee when the Senate returns from recess. Earlier, my colleague, Isha Sesay, spoke with Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. She asked him about President Obama's resolve to name a nominee sooner rather than later despite the Republican's vow to block it."", 'I think many presidents would make this move. You know, Wayne Gretzky, the famous hockey player, once said he missed every shot he never took. This is a shot that all presidents would like to take. Whether they make it is another question. The general rule has been that nominations that occur within two years of the end of a term are problematic. This is much closer than that and during a very contested, very heated and very passionate political race for the presidency. So the odds are against this president that he could get this through a Republican-controlled Senate.', ""And you said it's not just the issue of the amount of time the president has on hand. There are other issues that make this problematic?"", ""Well, that's right. I mean, first of all, the greatest problem that the president faces is that Nino Scalia is a conservative icon. He was, indeed, the intellectual force of the right on the court. He was legitimately viewed as an intellectual, someone that had great depth and scope in his opinions. There really isn't anyone on the court right now that -- on the right side that is -- would be viewed at his equal. For that type of iconic figure to be replaced by President Obama, for conservatives, is perfectly nightmarish. It is unlikely, highly unlikely that the president would ever nominate anyone that would be able to fill Scalia's shoes from the perspective of conservatives. And so if he even nominates a moderate, as opposed to a liberal, it would significantly move the center of gravity of the court to the left. And that's the reason it's unlikely that this is going to be anything but a battle royale with this nomination."", ""As you take a look at the battle royale that is shaping up, we've heard the rhetoric from those on the campaign trail hoping to take the place of President Obama in the Oval Office and from other members of the legislature. I mean, as you hear the rhetoric and the heat of the rhetoric, the tone, can you remember a time when it was ever this -- this -- this -- divided or divisive when it comes to picking a Supreme Court justice?"", 'Well, there is certainly more heat than light that\'s coming out of this. Unfortunately, that is not unprecedented. You know, we often forget that when the Constitution of the United States was written, it was written not just for times like this, but in times like this. You know, Jefferson referred to his predecessor as ""the reign of the witches."" This was a pretty poisonous time even back then. But the problem you have in any democratic system is it requires compromise, and sometimes there is not a compromise in the offing. Sometimes the parties are too far apart. That may be this case. There is very little runway left to get a compromise and there is also very little interest on either side, it seems, of reaching a real consensus on a candidate.', 'For almost three decades, Antonin Scalia was considered the conservative icon of the U.S. Supreme Court. And on the opposite side of the spectrum, his colleague, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is among the more liberal. Despite that, the ideological rivals had a very close relationship. Their families vacationed together. They even shared a love of opera.

I think most people were as well.', ""Political commentator Van Jones joins me now from New York. Van, thanks for being with us. Let's first talk about the birther issue. Donald Trump kept this going for some five years. It seemed like he was reluctant to end it but then he pointed the finger at Hillary Clinton for starting it. So, goodbye, birther movement, thank goodness. But what do you make --"", '-- of the end of this?', ""Well, I don't know if we've gotten to the end. First of all, it's such a bizarre thing for him to say. Apparently some friend of hers or maybe some staffer at one point said something. And so he's like, well, that is his excuse for five years? He doesn't follow Hillary Clinton on her tax policy. He doesn't follow her on her defense policy but -- or her trade policy. But for some reason, some low-level staffer working for Hillary Clinton is the reason that, for five years, Donald Trump just could not let this go. It's not credible. It turns out, yes, there's very thin factual basis. But the reality is that we have a nominee for a major party who seems to want to live in a fantasy land about a number of issues, including this one. That is not a good person to be in the White House."", ""What does it say about his thoughts on Barack Obama, how Barack Obama was put under this birther issue? He was basically saying, wasn't he, the president is a fraud. And he did it -- he perpetuated it with a little wink and a dodge as he went along."", ""Well, let's not forget, President Obama, in an unprecedented move, all the way back in 2011, five years ago, produced himself, personally, in front of the world, the long form birth certificate because he had been so goaded by Donald Trump for months and months and months. It was actually starting to impact public opinion, this complete lunatic idea that, for somehow this baby was born overseas and then smuggled back and just totally nutso stuff. So it really was undermining the full faith and confidence of the American people in the White House. And so Obama produced the certificate. Then since then, Donald Trump has continued to, as you said, dodge and wink and nod. If Donald Trump's rumors had been believed by the whole country, you could have had military people saying we do not have a legitimate commander in chief. He was playing fast and loose with the facts, very dangerous; glad it's coming to an end."", ""Yes, and finally, when he made a comment about it, he did so grudgingly, it seemed; he made it quick and he took no questions on it. So he kept this out there for years. But when it came time to sum it up, wouldn't take questions from the media."", ""Well, you know, that's not surprising, though. Donald Trump is so shy. You know, he is so retiring. He does not like to talk to reporters. He doesn't like to address issues. No, this is the one issue that he wanted to dodge. He knew that with the debates beginning later this month, if he didn't do something to take it off the table or at least give the pretense that he was, this was going to be part of the first or second debate question. And so he did the bare minimum of what he could do. First, he had his surrogates out there, trying to shoot it down. Finally, he came out with the bared, bare minimum. But this is one of the more appalling parts of the Obama years, Donald Trump continuing to try to delegitimate (sic) and undermine the sitting commander in chief."", 'Van Jones, thank you for joining us. We appreciate it.', 'Thank you.', ""He mentioned the debates. Well, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will face off in their first debate against each other September 26th. But there will be no third-party candidate on the stage with them. Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein won't be participating because they have not polled at 15 percent or higher in at least five national opinion polls. That's according to the Commission on Presidential Debates. It says it will review its criteria for the second and third debate. The U.S. has announced the death of another high-ranking ISIS leader. The Pentagon says a drone strike in Raqqah, Syria, killed ISIS' information minister, Wa'il Adil al-Salman. The air raid was on September 7th. The Pentagon says Salman was in charge of propaganda videos showing torture and executions. He had direct access to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Another ISIS leader, Mohammed al-Adnani, was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Syria August 30th. The U.S. is helping Turkey fight ISIS. A contingent of U.S. special operations forces is now assisting Turkey in its offensive against ISIS in Northern Syria. Turkish troops entered Syria in August just days after a suicide bomber killed 54 people at a wedding in Turkey. Some 40 special operations troops are now training and advising the Turks. The Pentagon calls the mission Operation Noble Lance. The U.S. was already providing air support to the Turkish offensive. The cease-fire that began Monday in Syria is holding. But humanitarian aid has still not reached hundreds of --"", '-- thousands of desperate people. And as our Frederik Pleitgen reports from Aleppo, mistrust is growing on both sides.', 'In Aleppo, this is what the cease-fire looks like, government forces moving around armored personnel carriers in a contested district. And oftentimes this is what the cease-fire sounds like. Syrian army personnel acknowledging they don\'t trust the truce. ""We\'re sticking to the cease-fire,"" this pro-government fighter says, ""but the other side is not. That\'s why I don\'t think the cease-fire will work."" For their part, rebels accuse government forces of breaching the cease-fire. Despite the transgressions, though, the U.N. says by and large the cessation of hostilities is working. But many Aleppo residents are still suffering from the clashes that took place before it went into effect. At the Ramouseh hospital, Ahmed Jabr and his 7-year-old son, Mahmud, lay side by side, both wounded by rebel shelling that killed three of Mahmud\'s brothers. ""When the bombshell fell, I went to the ground,"" the boy says, ""and I was bleeding. I felt the shrapnel in my body."" It happened last Friday, the day the cease-fire was announced, crushing Ahmed Jabr\'s faith that the cessation of hostilities might work. ""Even after the cease-fire, I was here in the hospital,"" he says, ""and I saw wounded people still being brought here."" And the calm remains strained. Damascus saw heavy clashes on Friday around the rebel-held districts of Jobar. And in the early morning hours of Friday, opposition and government forces exchanged fire right here on the outskirts of Aleppo, another sign of just how fragile the current cease-fire is -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Aleppo.', ""A Swedish court has upheld an arrest warrant for Julian Assange. What that means for the WikiLeaks founder. We'll have that coming up here. Also: the U.S. is reacting to shocking allegations against the Philippine president, including a claim that a death squad he controlled fed a body to a crocodile.

You can repeatedly denounce what is said by someone and then say but I'm still going to endorse him to be the most powerful person on the planet."", 'With us this Sunday to share their reporting and their insights: Julie Pace of ""The Associated Press"", Jonathan Martin of ""The New York Times"", Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg Politics, and Mary Katharine Ham of ""The Federalist"". The election now is in three weeks. The final debate in three days. And Donald Trump is losing. If you look at the national polls, there\'s a bit of a discrepancy, but if you go state by state, he\'s losing big league, to borrow a word. He says he knows why. First, all those women are lying and Trump says they are in cahoots with Mexican billionaires as part of a global conspiracy to defeat him. Yes. He really says that. And there\'s more, Hillary Clinton scored the winner of the first two debates. Well, Trump says she\'s obviously cheating.', ""We should take a drug test prior because I don know what's going on with her. But at the beginning of her last debate she was all pumped up at the beginning, and at the end, there was like oh, take me down. She could barely reach her car. So I think we should take a drug test.

I mean, what you're seeing with Trump is he watches the polls like the best of them and knows he's losing right now and he is choosing not to take any responsibility for that. He's choosing to point his finger at the media, at Clinton, at women who are coming out accusing him, and there's not a lot --"", 'Paul Ryan.', ""Paul Ryan, another Republicans. There's not a lot of self-reflection happening right now and for him that's dangerous because he has a loyal base of supporters. He cannot win the presidential election with those supporters alone. He needs to expand that base. And you're seeing very few signs of him reaching out trying to do anything in these last three weeks to bring new people into the fold."", ""And he just doesn't deny the allegations, as he denies them, he says number one, that we're all part of this, that we're part of some media conspiracy to bring these women forward to say these things. These women have attached their names and their reputations to this, I would say that. These are not anonymous sources. But then he also, at one point over the weekend, said look at them. Look at them. If I were going to do this, these aren't the women I would do it too, because look at them."", 'They are unattractive.', ""Ladies, I see that and I think, you know, that's -- if you're looking to expand your tent, that's not the way to do it."", ""He tweeted this morning. So, he knows that something is up. He did tweet that polls show large numbers of women are leaving him for something he didn't even do. But, you know, the CDC research shows that 44 percent of women have experienced unwanted sexual contact at some point in their lives, so this really strikes home for a lot of women. So, not -- he's not losing GOP women in droves. They are sticking with him for partisan reasons. But the poll numbers do show he's losing women and he clearly knows it now."", 'The ""she\'s not hot enough"" defense I don\'t think is a good and his problem as it always is, I don\'t think he\'s ever been in self-reflection or actually expanding the tent at all. It\'s been about the audience he\'s talking at the moment. And that sometimes work in a better way. But his goal has never been these things. Moving forward can he get off of this story? No, I don\'t think he can because he\'s not a person who changes his strategy in a nimble way. He\'s a guy who goes out and he\'s Donald Trump, and the reason people are leaving and reason people believe these accusations -- by the way, party idea being accused is not my metric for whether I believe these stories or not, which unfortunately in this town is often the metric. But I don\'t know if he can move off of this because there\'s a tape of him saying he did these things. That\'s the bottom line.', ""That's one of the issues. I don't like replay this gratuitously. But this -- we're going to play the gentle part here. But this is part of the problem. Donald Trump says this never happened. He says he would never do it. He adds, well, they're not attractive enough. But one of his issues is that the women are coming forward and essentially saying that Donald Trump did this."", ""I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything."", 'Whatever you want.', ""Again, he said in the debate that he was just talking, he doesn't do those things, but these women are saying is when they heard him in the debate deny it that's when they decided to come forward."", ""He's got a 30-year track record of boasting about his sexual exploits in the New York tabloids. I mean, this is not something we just heard about after that video came out. It was in his own book for crying out loud, talking about how he behaves. So, this is nothing new. Republican Party knew what they were getting. They went in with their eyes wide-open. And there's a bigger story here, John, than this campaign. He is upending long standing norms of American politics, not only in terms of his conduct when it comes to speaking about women or minorities but talking about the very nature of American democracy in a way we haven't seen in this country. And I think for the Republican Party to sort of stand there and watch him do that -- Paul Ryan spoke yesterday about it. But I've been very surprised that more people in the party have not spoken out about his comments regarding again the very fabric of --"", ""When you say not spoken out against it. He was introduced yesterday by Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama who -- I criticized Senator Sessions last week because he's a former state attorney general, he's a law and order guy, a former federal prosecutor, and he said that what Trump describes in that tape in his view is not sexual assault. Sorry, senator it is. But Senator Sessions then said the rigged argument. This is a man who among conservatives has standings on issues of law and order. It's not just Donald Trump now. A lot of conservatives say, is Donald Trump one of us? Jeff Sessions is on immigration, on the Supreme Court, he's a guy a lot of conservatives look up to. He stood up and said it is rigged. Before you bring it to the conversation, the Democrats are watching this, too. Listen to Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's vice presidential running mate. He's essentially telling Democrats, do not think this is over. Do not stay home because of all this. It's rigged argument. The margins matter."", 'We got to make sure that the margin that he loses by is so big, and so clear, and so powerful, and so unmistakable that when he stands up and says, ""Poor me and it was rigged against me,"" nobody will believe him.', ""We'll find the advance guy about that mural behind Senator Kaine. But this is -- you know, we laugh about these things sometimes, but if you read the accounts, you've been to the Trump rally, of some of the things Trump supporters say, that here's a guy who spent so much time legitimizing President Obama, he's not from this country, now he's in advance trying to delegitimize a Clinton victory if that's what it comes to."", ""Look, I think -- let me say this. I don't think it's not crazy for him to point out and for his supporters to be a little miffed by the fact that there's pretty coordinated roll out of these stories about women, that in fact with the Alicia Machado thing, you had several stories coming down the pike from Cosmopolitan that had been set up before she used to that line. And to look at the media and go, hey, you guys haven't been friendly to us for a long time and this seems like you're working together. I don't think that's a crazy thing to say. When you take it the extra step and say that the entire system is rigged, I think that's problem. But he's done that -- again, with the Republican Party knowing what it's getting. He's done that every step of the way. Every primary race he lost, it was because it was rigged."", 'Right.', ""And I think it's really important, though, that people sometimes in these elections, you get really caught up in the day-to- day and the race that we're in. Step back and think about this. We have had election after election in this country where the result is accepted as fair, it was a free election, and the loser steps aside and accepts the results. I don't think you can say for certain that Donald Trump will take that position after this election. And that is incredibly dangerous not just because you're going to have his supporters out there thinking that Hillary Clinton is not legitimate, but it could freeze our democracy for her entire -- if she's elected, for her entire four years. Republicans would have to choose whether they want to work with her. We're talking about something much bigger than just Donald Trump's talk and rhetoric on the campaign trail."", 'I mean, I can\'t believe you have to say this out loud on TV but the essence of democracy is the peaceful transfer of power that is undisputed between parties every four years. And that does seem to be now the question. Real fast to Mary Katharine\'s point about nature of these women coming out. Two things. First of all, a lot of them said they heard it in the second debate say he had done these things and said, hell no, he actually did it to me and I\'ll speak to that. Second of all, in April, the ""Boston Globe,"" and in May, my paper, ""The New York Times"", had stories about other women. That was not some part of coordinated idea. So, this is --', 'Things of this nature have existed --', 'Yes.', 'If it is -- if it is all coordinated by the Clinton campaign here\'s what I would say in these things. If I rob a bank and my worst enemy tapes me robbing the back and provides the tape to the police, I can scream at my worst enemy all I want, but I still robbed the bank. Just before we go quickly, I just want to say, if you\'re a Trump supporter, there\'s encouraging news this morning. You\'ve been listening in the past week, FOX News, NBC/Wall Street Journal poll had him down to 11 at one point. And then it came back to 8. FOX News had him down at six. There\'s a ""Washington Post""/ABC poll this morning that has a margin of now four. Clinton 47, Trump 43. So, if you\'re a Trump supporter, you\'re saying, OK, there\'s some damage, but not horrendous damage. This is one poll. I always tell people don\'t believe one poll. Just a point of context, on this day in 2012, 23 days out, President Obama was plus one. The debates were later in that campaign and on the date of the third debate, which is the 16th of October, Romney was plus one. So, as we look at these margins yes that\'s a closer race than some of the other polls show. If it\'s four points nationally on Election Day, knowing what we know at the state level, do we have any doubts that that\'s a Clinton win?', ""No. Battleground states, Trump campaign is targeting 11 battleground states and she's winning in ten of them. The only one he's winning in Iowa and he's up by three points. Now, it's close, it's not over in some states, Ohio, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, they are within three points. But for the most part, she's ahead in ten battleground states."", 'We\'ll go more state by state in a little bit. Everybody, sit tight. Up next, the Republican Party in full panic, worried Trump at the top of the ticket might mean lows come Election Day. Though, first a Donald Trump tweet this morning calls it a hit job by a boring and unfunny show. Here\'s ""Saturday Night Live\'s"" take on the many awkward moments in the second presidential debate.', ""Can't deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition.

I don't know whether she is quite as comfortable telling jokes on stage as president Obama but I think particularly tonight it's got to be a challenge after everything that went on last night to sit in a room, share a stage with Donald Trump and put a smile on your face and tell a bunch of jokes, it's going to be hard."", 'Will, you were in the room, walk me through the brain storming process, writing for Romney. How low can you go on jabs at the other candidate?', ""Sure, well, writing for Romney is kind of like being Trump's policy director, you write a lot but not much gets used. So there's different sample jokes, they try different gags, the point is the best jokes from politicians are when the politician is being self-deprecating. That will be tough tonight when the people telling the jokes either think they're the greatest person in the world or can't admit to ever doing anything. So I think the people going to the Al Smith Dinner should be prepared to kind of cringe their way through the evening."", 'On the cringe factor let me play sound, this is from the Donald Trump Comedy Central Roast to see if he can be self- deprecating, here you go.', ""What's the difference between a wet raccoon and Donald Trump's hair?

Does he have it?', ""You know, he's done this a lot, he goes back to the well with the hair stuff.

Do you think he'll take the jabs lightly tonight especially given what we saw last night?"", ""I don't think Donald Trump likes when people laugh at him. That's an understatement. Even that joke from the Comedy Central Roast, in theory that is self-deprecating I think there is good chance he used that self-deprecating joke to inflate his own net worth by several billion dollars, so I'm not sure taking himself down a peg is not an arrow in his quiver."", 'What is the best fodder, Will, you said stop it with the hair jokes. Like what would be a great joke or a great bit for Trump, and then David same question on Hillary. Will, you first.', 'The funniest jokes are when you reference the elephant in the room. Given his delegitimizing the election last night and the tension that exists between these two people, people are dying for civility between these two and this could be a way to show that by showing -- poking fun at yourself, poking fun at the process, poking fun at the room, but the question is can either of these candidates be humble enough to do that?', 'David?', ""I would point out I think Donald Trump drew a laugh last night when he said no one respects women more than he does. So he's got one laugh under his belt."", 'That destroyed the room. That was the biggest laugh of the night.', ""That really killed.

Some of you guys remember after my foreign trip in 2008 I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas, and I have to say I'm impressed with how well governor Romney has avoided that problem."", 'People seem to be curious as to how we prepare from the debate. Let me tell you what I do. First, refrain from alcohol for 65 years before the debate. Second, find the biggest available straw man and mercilessly attack it. Big Bird didn\'t even see it coming. And by the way, in the spirit of ""Sesame Street"", the president\'s remarks tonight are brought to by the letter O and number 16 trillion.', 'That was pretty good. Joining me now a man who was part of the team writing jokes for Mitt Romney that night. Will Ritter is with me, and David Litt, a former speech writer for president Obama now head writer at Funny Or Die D.C. Nice to have both of you on. David, first of all, do you think Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton has a sense of humor?', ""Everybody I know who knows Hillary Clinton personally says she is a really funny in person. I don't know whether she is quite as comfortable telling jokes on stage as president Obama but I think particularly tonight it's got to be a challenge after everything that went on last night to sit in a room, share a stage with Donald Trump and put a smile on your face and tell a bunch of jokes, it's going to be hard."", 'Will, you were in the room, walk me through the brain storming process, writing for Romney. How low can you go on jabs at the other candidate?', ""Sure, well, writing for Romney is kind of like being Trump's policy director, you write a lot but not much gets used. So there's different sample jokes, they try different gags, the point is the best jokes from politicians are when the politician is being self-deprecating. That will be tough tonight when the people telling the jokes either think they're the greatest person in the world or can't admit to ever doing anything. So I think the people going to the Al Smith Dinner should be prepared to kind of cringe their way through the evening."", 'On the cringe factor let me play sound, this is from the Donald Trump Comedy Central Roast to see if he can be self- deprecating, here you go.', ""What's the difference between a wet raccoon and Donald Trump's hair? A wet raccoon doesn't have 7 billion (bleeping) dollars in the bank. Very funny, OK, very funny."", 'What do you think, Will? Does he have it?', ""You know, he's done this a lot, he goes back to the well with the hair stuff. I think it's kind of cheap, he's thin skinned and you saw in the clip you played the White House Correspondent's Dinner, Obama making fun of him probably launched this entire campaign."", 'That was a Comedy Central Roast where he got a bit of a standing ovation, I was there in 2011. This was when president Obama had the birther joke and I remember looking over to Donald Trump what will you see for yourself if he left?', 'Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising since I just assumed he was running as a joke.', ""We all know about your credentials and breadth of experience. For example -- seriously, recently in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice you didn't blame Little John or Meatloaf. You fired Gary Busey. And these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night."", ""Sort of dead pan, David. Kind of laughing along like that uncomfortable I think there are cameras on me, I should laugh. Do you think he'll take the jabs lightly tonight especially given what we saw last night?"", ""I don't think Donald Trump likes when people laugh at him. That's an understatement. Even that joke from the Comedy Central Roast, in theory that is self-deprecating I think there is good chance he used that self-deprecating joke to inflate his own net worth by several billion dollars, so I'm not sure taking himself down a peg is not an arrow in his quiver."", 'What is the best fodder, Will, you said stop it with the hair jokes. Like what would be a great joke or a great bit for Trump, and then David same question on Hillary. Will, you first.', 'The funniest jokes are when you reference the elephant in the room. Given his delegitimizing the election last night and the tension that exists between these two people, people are dying for civility between these two and this could be a way to show that by showing -- poking fun at yourself, poking fun at the process, poking fun at the room, but the question is can either of these candidates be humble enough to do that?', 'David?', ""I would point out I think Donald Trump drew a laugh last night when he said no one respects women more than he does. So he's got one laugh under his belt."", 'That destroyed the room. That was the biggest laugh of the night.', ""That really killed. I think for Hillary Clinton the most important thing, I agree with Will, I think being self-deprecating, acknowledging Donald Trump's behavior and his many faiings as a candidate, but most importantly recognizing that the Al Smith Dinner is about poking fun at the other person but you have to make sure you laugh at yourself."", ""We'll take it live tonight. The big dinner that is the countdown clock for this dinner, David Litt, Will Ritter, thanks guys. Coming up on CNN, Hillary Clinton accused of leaking state secrets when she described how long it takes to launch a nuclear weapon. We'll fact check those allegations coming up.""]","['BALDWIN', 'MITT ROMNEY, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE', 'BARACK OBAMA', 'ROMNEY', 'OBAMA', 'ROMNEY', 'BALDWIN', 'DAVID LITT, FORMER SPEECH WRITER FOR OBAMA', 'BALDWIN', 'WILL RITTER, WRITER FOR MITT ROMNEY', 'BALDWIN', 'DONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE', 'BALDWIN', 'RITTER', 'BALDWIN', 'UNIDENTIFIED MALE COMIC', 'OBAMA', 'BALDWIN', 'LITT', 'BALDWIN', 'RITTER', 'BALDWIN', 'LITT', 'RITTER', 'LITT', 'BALDWIN']"

Alison, good morning."", ""Good morning, Victor and Christi. And Merry Christmas to both of you. Let's get a check on the top stories right now. Russian military officials say no survivors were found at the scene of a military plane crash near Sochi today, 92 people were on board the plane. Some wreckage was found in the Black Sea. And state media is reporting it was carrying a military music group on its way to perform at a Russian airbase in Syria. President Vladimir Putin now ordering an investigation and declaring tomorrow a national day of mourning. President-elect Donald Trump's controversial foundation is going away. Trump says he's doing away with the charity to avoid potential conflicts of interest once he takes office. But shutting it down may not be that simple because the foundation is under investigation in New York State for alleged misuse of donations and can't be dissolved until the investigation is over. DNC Deputy Communications Director Eric Walker is saying the move was what he called, a wilted fig leaf to cover up his -- quote -- pitiful record of charitable giving. The Trump Foundation has no employees and has about $1 million in asset. Israel now says that it's re-evaluating its relationship with the United Nations. After the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank in East Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says, Israel is now canceling millions of dollars in contributions to U.N. organizations. In Bethlehem the church of nativity is now holding Christmas mass. You're looking at a live picture there. The West Bank town is where Christians believe Jesus was born. Thousands of people are expected to visit sites in Bethlehem, Jerusalem and Nazareth over the holiday. Buckingham Palace says a bad cold will keep Queen Elizabeth from attending a Christmas day service. Ian Lee is in London. Good morning, Ian. What can you tell us more about some information about what's going on here?"", 'Good morning, Alison. We learned about this cold a few days ago when she postponed her trip to Sandringham where she spends Christmas with other members of the royal family. She was unable to go via helicopter, not her traditional way of going via train. But her first public appearance was going to be at Christmas service at the church there but it looks like that heavy cold is keeping her at home. This is what the palace had to say. They said the queen continues to recover from a heavy cold and will stay indoors to assist with her recovery. Her majesty will participate in royal family Christmas celebrations during the day. Alison.', 'Being described as a heavy cold, but how serious do you think this illness really is?', ""Well, the royals are notoriously private about their health, but when you look at other members of the royal family you have Prince William with his wife visiting his in-laws in Berkshire and you have other members of the royal family going to Christmas service either (ph) or as well. And you also have in the statement saying that she's still going to participate in family functions. So it does seem like it isn't terribly serious."", 'All right. We certainly wish her well. Ian Lee, thank you so much for your report. Christi and Victor, back to you.', ""Well, we're at the end almost of 2016 so it's a good time to look over the year and really ask ourselves how did we get here?"", ""The race to the White House, of course, we're talking about.

So Jake Tapper looks back at what has been an unprecedented 12 months in politics."", ""This year everything we thought we knew about politics was turned on its head.

For the final time as president, I am pleased to award our nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom."", ""The vice president could barely contain his tears.

I remember once she told the White House press that, you know, if we're not doing it, don't put it in the press. And that's also what I me about that authenticity.

I`m Carl Azuz for CNN 10. Give us 10 minutes, we`ll break down international news for you. Thanks for watching this Thursday. We`re starting with report from the World Meteorological Organization. It`s part of the United Nations that studies climate. And it says that 2016 was the Earth`s warmest year on record since scientists started maintaining temporary records in the 1880s. Researchers say that 2016 was seven hundredths of one degree Fahrenheit warmer than 2015. That was the previous record holder. The U.N. organization says it used several sources like NASA, to come up with its data, though one of them, the United Kingdom`s Met Office says the temperature increase it measured was within its margin of error, according to the BBC. So, the record is not certain across all measurements. One big factor in the warm temperatures was a powerful El Nino, a natural warming of Pacific Ocean surface temperatures that affected the climate from 2015 to 2016. But a scientist from NASA says greenhouse gas emissions, which are given off by human activity, are responsible for warming temperatures in the long-term. Because of the recent El Nino event has subsided, scientists do not expect 2017 to break a new warming record. Yesterday afternoon, U.S. President Barack Obama gave his final news conference while in office. It was likely the last time he`d speak in public as president. A lot of subjects were covered, increasingly strained U.S. relations with Israel and Russia, the relationship between the White House and the media, a recent move to reduce the sentences of more prisoners than any other U.S. president. It all came up. And President Obama was asked about his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the controversies he`s been involved in. The outgoing leader said he and the incoming one had had constructive and sometimes lengthy conversations. But Mr. Obama said the best piece of advice he could give to Mr. Trump was to rely on others around him, as the presidency isn`t a job that anyone can do alone.', 'I believe in this country. I believe in the American people. I believe that people are more good than bad. I believe tragic things happen. I think there`s evil in the world. But I think that, at the end of the day, if we work hard and if we`re true to those things in us that feel true and feel right, that the world gets a little better each time. That`s what this presidency has tried to be about, and I see in the young people I`ve worked with. At my core, I think we`re going to be OK. We just had to fight for it. We have to work for it, and not take it for granted. And I know that you will help us do that. Thank you very much, press corps. Good luck.', 'Ten-second trivia: In terms of when it gained independence, which of these countries is oldest? Austria, Morocco, Brazil, or Switzerland? The Swiss Confederation got its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499, making it the oldest independent nation on this list.', 'Every winter, there`s an international meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the World Economic Forum. It`s an organization that includes politicians, businesspeople, scholars, sometimes actors, basically movers and shakers. They aimed to improve the world by addressing issues like poverty, conflict and the global economy. But the event has also been criticized as an elitist meeting that does more talking than actual problem-solving. Either way, the meeting that`s going on right now is looking at the uncertainty of the year ahead, like an investor or a skier might look at risk and then try to minimize it.', '2016 was a year of surprises. The word here in Davos is that 2017 could present similar challenges. So, what are some of the risks facing the global business community? Something that could take a nice outing and turn it into an injury, steady growth into a global recession? As the political and business elites gather here in Davos, 2017 could shape up to be a year of extreme risks, and here are the biggest: U.S. going off the path and into the trees where there`s less visibility. All eyes, if you will, will be on President Trump. Will he blaze his own trail when it comes to trade? U.S. involvement within the NATO alliance, and how about the U.S., for example, in the Middle East? How about Chinese moguls? Economic relations with Beijing are always a little bit bumpy. How tough will the moguls get this year? Europe potentially going off a cliff. One major obstacle here in Davos is the widening gap between the rich and the poor, and the resentment that`s creating within the European Union. There are major elections this year. France, Germany and the Netherlands, and the results could push Europe over the political cliff (ph). So, I`ve chosen the ultimate route, slow and steady, hard work but less risky, with the ultimate goal of avoiding disaster in 2017.', 'These are crashes are helping researches make drones safer. These experiments are helping predict injuries caused by drone collisions. Dummies are rigged with sensors that measure the force of a crash. And determine if a collision will cause a neck or brain injury. The research is key for drone regulation in the U.S. Researchers are hoping to make drones safer.', 'Facing challenges concerning military conflicts, political opposition, foreign and domestic criticism, security threats, not to mention governing a country, it is no wonder why the American presidency is said to cause people to age faster, at least physically. But does that necessarily mean that U.S. leaders live shorter lives than the rest of us.', 'It`s that time again. Time for news organization to roll out those before and after photos to show how much our departing president has aged. It`s been dubbed ""the White House effect"" and it usually involves wrinkles and white hair, or as Michelle Obama puts it --', 'My very own silver fox.', 'Maybe you`ve heard there`s a formula for presidential aging.', 'A typical president ages two years for every year they`re in office. And there really is one reason, it`s the stress.', 'No, it`s not true. They do not age at twice the normal rate.', 'Longevity expert Professor J. Olhansky disputes Dr. Michael Roizen`s formula.', 'Perhaps the graying of the hair and wrinkling of the skin may grow more rapidly as a result of stress, but it`s certainly not shortening their lives.', 'Professor Olhansky says research shows presidents live way longer than regular citizens. Sure presidents look like they`re going downhill in photos.', 'But guess what? If you take a picture of anybody eight years apart, you`re going to see the same changes in the rest of us as you see in the presidents.', 'Really? So what? That`s me eight years ago. Do you think the grueling life of a TV humor reporter has taken a toll? (voice-over): Wonder how long it will take 70-year-old Donald Trump`s hair to change shades once he`s president. Though Michelle Obama seems immune from the White House effect --', 'The only way to date her in photos is by looking at me. Here we are in 2008, here we are a few years later and this one is from two weeks ago.', 'So, in all fairness, how about the aging of a CNN STUDENT NEWS and now, CNN 10 anchor? Is age just a number? Certainly, an age old question, which is itself a popular adage. Whatever you think, the only thing I`ll tell you about my own age is the same truth I would have told you eight years ago -- I`m older than your brother but younger than your dad.

Then, he`ll officially become the president. Then, he`ll deliver his inauguration speech, have lunch with the Senate, attend the inaugural parade, go to an inaugural ball, or several.

CNN-325673,CNN'S AMANPOUR,2017-11-09,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1711/09/ampr.01.html,,Albright condemns the trump effect on U.S. diplomacy. ,"[""Tonight, Trump on a charm offensive in China urging Beijing to do more to reign in Yang. The South Korean vice foreign minister tells me compromise is possible but the balls in Kim Jong Uu's court."", 'Kim Jong should make up his mind to come to a negotiation table. Only when they come to a negotiation table, we might be able to offer them some character you were just describing.', ""Also ahead, Trump blames his predecessor, not his host for the widening China trade deficit. I talked to David Axelrod, President Obama's Senior Advisor and Chief Strategist."", 'Ironically, he campaigned on getting tough on China. He been the best gift China could receive, I think around most of Asia, there is a since of American withdraw.', ""Good evening everyone and welcome to the program, I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Day two in China and President Trump trade tough talk for flattery. The U.S. President called his host, President Xi Jinping, a very special man and he even praised China's trade policy which he considers unfair."", ""I don't blame China. After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens. I give China great credit."", 'This of course is a far cry from candidate Trump, who aggressively went off to China on this very issue.', ""We can't continue to allow China to rape our country and that's what they're doing. It's the greatest theft in the history of the world."", ""It hard to say how much his diplomatic outreach now. Trump has warned North Korea not to try us and he needs XI to put more pressure on Yang. With it's trade mark hyperbole, North Korea state newspaper called the President's words warmongering, filthy rhetoric spewing out of his snout like garbage. With surely the most to lose in the event of military conflict, South Korea. Trump was there earlier this week and today I asked Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam whether Washington and D.C. now saw eye to eye on how to deal with the nuclear threat."", 'Minister, welcome to our program.', 'Thank you for having me on.', 'Well you are an incredibly important country at an incredibly important place right now. So how would you assess the state of affairs between you an the United States and between you and North Korea right now? Was it intentional that the rhetoric from President Trump was more muted, more subtle than it had been before his visit to South Korea?', ""Well I think the relationship between Korea and the United States couldn't' be better. In particular the very successful state visit by President Trump had provided us with an opportunity to show the strong solidarity between our two allies and at the same time, we could really reconfirm that Washington and Seoul are exactly the same page in our approach toward the North Korean nuclear issue. And at the same time, we believe that the speech made by President Trump at our national assembly sent a very balanced and nice message to North Korea."", ""SO let me just take the first bit of what you just said that relations couldn't be better and we're on the same page. So does that mean President Trump has withdrawn the accusation or the characterization of President Um as an appeaser when it came to North Korea? Does that mean that you feel that President Trump may no longer want to pull the special trade deal that U.S. and South Korea have together? Have you gone any further in that regard?"", ""I'm not aware of the kind of harsh criticism of President Trump against my president. Having said that, both presidents during the visit have agreed to work for the better FTA in an experienced manor and so far the FTA between Korea and the U.S. has served our two countries in a mutually beneficial way - mutually beneficial manor. We believe, through the negotiations while could take place in the near future, we might be able to walk together to make up the better deal between Seoul and Washington."", ""So as we look at the FTA's you said the free trade agreement. Let's again focus on the real issue at the heart of national security concern, and that is North Korea. You have heard what presidential, the leader Kim Jong-un has said he said that you know President Trump's language was wreaked of gun power powder and that it's you know emerged from the snout. I mean it was pretty ugly language as they are known to do."", ""Well, what would you expect from the North Korean President? In response to the speech made by President Trump at our national assembly. It is something that we can expect, but having said that, I would like to emphasize that Kim Jong has relatively quiet in term of provocations since it's last missile launch on September 15th."", 'Do you expect, because your intelligence agencies reported last week that there may be a missile test or indeed an above ground nuclear test.', 'Well that kind of possibility could not always be removed 100 percent from our expectations, but having said that, if we could have create an environment where Jong-un would not bear any kind of further provocations I think that would be the desirable situation we are all aiming at.', 'So President Trump has said, look it has got to work out, we must make it work out. President (ph) said was would be unthinkable. What are the concrete steps that you may have come to regarding the next way forward with North Korea?', ""Right now, I believe we are all focused on (pressure) and sanctions but both Korea and the US together with the China on the same page in terms of applying the strategy of pressure in engagement towards North Korea. Although we will continue to exert pressure upon the regime in Jong-un, so the full implementation of the UN (ph) Council Sanctions at one point we hope that Jong-un will be able to change it's mind and the strategy calculation regarding the value of nuclear weapons and recent problems so that they can come to a negotiation table for a very serious (ph) on the (ph)."", ""President Trump said come to the table make a deal, but a deal is a two way street so you're talking about the pressure of the sanctions from your end, but where is the carrot for North Korea? What are the allies prepared to do to make a negotiation and compromise?"", ""Well, first of all, Jung-un should make up its mind to come to a negotiation table. Only when they come to a negotiation table, we might be able to offer them some carrots that you were describing. But we might be able to make all the efforts to bring the horse to away spring but we can't make the horse drink the water, likewise Jung-un on his on and under certain pressures from the outside world, should be able to think twice at the cost of having nuclear weapons programs and at the cost of being pressured upon the sanctions of the regimes."", 'Is it possible that as part of the negotiations the United States, South Korea, the allies will (ph) Jung-un that they are not interested in regime change? And is it possible that they could be freeze for freeze, another words is Jung-un agrees to naturalize the nuclear threat then there might be less need for that amount of US military presence and exercises on the Korean peninsular?', 'Well first of all, Sole and Washington could be more clear regarding our intentions it is a no regime collapse or no regime change in North Korea. Secretary Tillerson has made it clear on many occasions, and Sole is exactly on the same page in that regard. Therefore, we believe that in a sense we have been already sending message to Jung-un reassuring them of our intentions. With regard to the freeze for freeze you just talked about, I think the freeze of the nuclear programs in North Korea could be at the entrance but it is not the final goal of our negotiations when and if there are negotiations.', 'In that note, Vice Minister LIM, thank you so much indeed for joining us from Sole.', 'Thank you so much for having me on. Thank you.', ""Now one person who's not won over by Trump's Asia tour is the former Secretary of State is Madeleine Albright. She told CNN today that diplomacy on the Trump threatens American's vital interest."", ""I think it's dangerous because he is now on a truly important trip that presents huge opportunities that under normal circumstances needs the support of a diplomat. One to prepare the trip, and two then to back it up, and we don't have a - an ambassador in South Korea. I teach at Georgetown and that's where a lot of people - young people who want to go into the Foreign Service and serve our country are now wondering is it worth it, why should we do it, and we are cutting off our pipelines. So it isn't just today, it is what the future holds for American diplomacy."", ""When we come back the man behind the one, President Obama's Svengali and Political Strategist David Axelrod on whether Trump is more than just anything but Obama."", ""Welcome back to the program. As President Trump grapples with the North Korean crisis, it's worth remembering that Barack Obama warned the incoming President Korean nukes would be his biggest challenge. Just as the Bush Whitehouse warned President Obama that Iran's nuclear program would be his biggest foreign policy challenge. So how do Obama's closest confidants feel seeing President Trump try to dismantle the Iran agreement and trade insults with Kim Jong-Un. David Axelrod was as close as it gets to President Obama as his Senior Advisor and Chief Campaign Strategist. I got his take on all of this when he joined me here in the studio. David Axelrod welcome to the program."", 'Great to be here.', ""I want to ask you about Trump's first major visit to Asia on the first anniversary of his election. What message and vibe about America is he taking around the rest of the world, especially compared to what Obama did."", ""Well they have fundamentally different views it's just speaking about Asia. His decision to withdraw from the TPP was a gift to China. Ironically he campaigned on getting tough on China. He's been the best gift China could receive. So I think around most of Asia there is a sense of American withdraw that has opened up an opportunity for the Chinese. Obviously everyone's watching with interest in how he deals with North Korea."", ""What I was going to ask you because what we understand although I'm not sure that it's ever been actually confirmed publically was that President Obama warned President Trump that actually this would be his biggest challenge. President Obama was warned that Iran would a biggest challenge."", 'Yes', 'Is that true?', ""Well I think it is true, and I think it was right. The fact is that North Korea has awarded President after President of both parties and their nuclear program has proceeded at pace. And they're really despite the menacing of the President. There aren't a lot of great options because any military action invites retaliatory strikes on South Korea on Japan that could jeopardize millions of people."", ""I mean and so this here massively important trip for that reason and everybody presumably wishes the President well because it's an extensile threat to the globe. But I guess part of it is also complicated by the President's disregard for the Iran nuclear accord and the potential risk is putting that out."", 'Exactly, well if you want to bring people to the negotiating table then you have to live by the agreements that you make. The signals that he\'s sending relative to Iran are being monitored by the North Koreans, and they have to ask themselves the question, ""if we sign an agreement, what exactly will it mean?"" So yes, I mean I don\'t know that the president sees all of these things as part of a larger puzzle. Some of his aids may, but he doesn\'t seem to. And his menacing of Kim Jong-un plays well particularly with his base back home. How it\'s interpreted by the North Koreans I think is a different question, and that\'s the great risk - the risk of miscalculation.', ""So let's talk about his base because this week was the first anniversary of the election, and there was an election - and important one - in the United States. Clearly you must be thrilled, vindicated about the election results in the United States."", ""Yes. Well I look at it more clinically now because in my role at CNN and the University of Chicago I try and look at things a little more clinically, but from a democratic standpoint there's no doubt that this was a very, very strong election, and it seems to be a message election. It doesn't seem that this was isolated to Virginia, for example, where democrats won a huge victory. But in all the races around the country - and there was some isolated races all over the country - democrats won largely on the strength of an energized democratic base and particularly in suburban areas where a lot of the key elections are going to take place in 2018. So if you're a republican, you have to be deeply concerned of the signals this election sent."", 'What about people who are saying, ""well what does the democratic party stand for? What is the democratic party\'s message today?"" Only 37 percent in July said the party stands for something whereas 52 percent said it just stands against Trump. Is that a real weakness and a threat for your party?', ""Well it's very hard for legislative parties to develop a message - a unified message because we're a big, diverse country. People run on their own messages. I think there is a overarching sense of resistance to Trump that unifies democrats. There's debates within the democratic party. There's a more populist wing in the democratic party. There's a more of an establishment wing. But the gulf between those two wings is less dramatic than what you find in the republican party today, but there's no doubt that the democratic party is not going to really be defined until there's a presidential candidate to define. That's the way it's always been, and that's the way it'll be in these next few years."", ""OK, let's get back to Trump and Obama. This is what President Trump said shortly after he was inaugurated about the Obama administration."", ""I inherited a mess. It's a mess at home and abroad. A mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country - you see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay-low (ph) wages, mass instability overseas no matter where you look, the Middle East a disaster, North Korea - we'll take care of it, folks. We're going to take of it all. I just want to let you know I inherited a mess."", 'So he inherited a mess.', ""That's what he says."", 'It looks like he wants to do -', 'I tell you - I tell you -', '-- anything but Obama.', 'Right.', ""But his people say no. That's not what motivates President Trump. It's not just about undoing president Obama's legacy. How do you see it?"", ""Well first of all let me just say we would have gladly traded the mess that Donald Trump inherited for the mess that Barak Obama inherited when he became president in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression with two wars raging 180,000 troops engaged in active combat situations overseas. So things were - objectively things were much better when Trump took office, but I don't think he really had - I don't think he expected to be elected president. I don't think he brought a governing philosophy. I think he basically is influenced by how he is playing in any given moment, and if something looks like it can appeal particularly to his political base he pursues that. Yes, I think he is motivated by his desire to sully Obama's reputation. I think he resents that Obama left as a very popular president and he entered as an unpopular president - more unpopular today. So anything that Obama was involved in he seems to want to undo."", 'But these are really important issues like Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act --', 'Yes.', '-- like the Paris Climate Accord, and we just talked about the Iran Nuclear Deal - really significant globally important and domestically important.', ""And this is the concern because he views them as political theater and political opportunities, there are real substantive policy implications on all of these things, you know, I think his aides have slowed him on Iran, he took sort of a half way measure there, now it's in congress's lap but he hasn't withdrawn from the agreement yet. That would have enormous implications. The Affordable Care Act he tried to undo but, and he's trying to strangle it through administrative procedures but it's quite popular now with the public."", 'And talking about Obama, I just want to play this little snippet of what he said during a campaign event for Ralph Northam in Virginia.', ""You notice I've been commenting a lot on politics lately, but here's one thing I know; if you have to win a campaign by dividing people, you're not going to be able to govern them. We need you to take this seriously, because our democracy is at stake."", 'So, democracy is at stake says the president, former president.', ""Well look, I think there are challenges to our democracy all over the world right now, particularly in developed nations where technology globalization have created winners and losers and social media is pervasive. And organizes people by tribe, these are challenges for democracy and there's no doubt that Donald Trump got elected president by mining those divisions, mining those differences and still does. As president, that is not helpful to democracy."", 'David Axelrod thanks so much for joining us.', 'Always good to be with you.', ""And you can go online to see what David Axelrod says about Donna Brazile, the former DNC Chair person who has said that President Obama did not do enough to build up the grass roots of the Democratic Party. Well the jury is out on whether President Trump will overturn all of Obama's signature achievements, but court is definitely in session. The former president and constitutional lawyer caused a flutter in Chicago when he turned up for jury duty this week trying to do his civic duty but the would be juror was quickly dismissed. When we come back, Trump missed out on the legendary Beijing smog and perhaps the chance to witness climate change first hand. But smog is currently choking New Delhi. Imagine the big smoke closing down India's capital; that's next."", ""And finally tonight imagine choking on the air you're meant to breathe. Delhi has declared a pollution emergency as smog has amuck blotting out the sun and emptying streets as people take cover. It is being blamed largely on crop burning and industry. Schools closed on Wednesday after Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister saw people throwing up out the window of a school bus. Now the city is being described as a gas chamber. With air pollution reaching 30 times the safe level, simply breathing has been compared to smoking around 50 cigarettes a day. Some who brave the outdoors do so in gas masks. But many don't. Either way the smog is taking a toll."", ""There's a burning sensation in my eyes. I feel suffocated I also get a headache. I feel like I should stop working, but what can I do? I have to work."", ""I brought my children here and they are also having breathing problems. We have come to see the Indian Presidential palace but it's been half an hour and we have not been able to see anything."", ""Now the city is trying to peel back its noxious nightmare cutting down traffic and blocking construction work so that people can once, again breathe easy. That is it for our program tonight. Just before we go, coming up tomorrow we'll have more from my revealing interview with North Korea's former deputy ambassador to the U.K. who defected and spoke to me from Washington."", ""North Koran propaganda system always tell north Korean population that North Korea was totally destroyed through ashes during Korean war by American bombing and North Korean people, are taught every day America is going to attack North Korea at any moment. That's why North Korean population should be ready at any moment for possible war like that. So I think that we should disseminate inflation that America is not their enemy. America can hurt North Korea and it is a wrong propaganda by the authority."", ""That new insight tomorrow. And we'll also have an exclusive TV interview with Masuta Basanie. He's stepping down as President of Iraq Kurdistan. For now remember you can listen to our podcast, see us on-line at Amanpour on-line, and follow me on Facebook and Twitter. Thanks for watching and good bye from London.

CNN-349591,NEW DAY SATURDAY,2018-09-08,http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1809/08/ndaysat.03.html,,"Source: Trump Obsessed with Identifying Op-Ed Author; Cohen Wants His $130,000 Back From Stormy Daniels; Ex-Trump Campaign Aide Sentenced to 14 Days In Prison; Obama Takes on GOP and Trump Ahead Of Midterms","[""What they've done is virtually treason."", 'This comes as Trump is now demanding the attorney general launch an investigation to uncover the identity of the person.', 'Former', 'We do not pressure the Attorney General or the FBI to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish our political opponents. It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause.', ""I'm sorry, I watched it, but I fell asleep."", 'This is ""New Day Weekend"" with Victor Blackwell and Christy Paul.', 'There are all kinds of theories and so many denials surrounding who wrote that anonymous New York Times Op-Ed that was so critical of the President.', 'Yes, well now aides to the President think they have the search narrowed down to just a few individuals. A source close to the White House says President Trump is obsessed with finding out who this is, even as Chief of Staff, John Kelly tells him to let it go.', 'Now, after a week that saw really strong job numbers and a Supreme Court nominee one step closer to confirmation, President Trump is telling reporters, he thinks exposing the Op-Ed writer is a matter of national security and wants Attorney General Jeff sessions to look into that.', ""Supposing I have a high level national security, he has got clearance, we talk about clearances a lot recently, and he goes into a high level meeting concerning China or Russia or North Korea or something and this guy goes in. I don't want him in those meetings."", 'So will an investigation reveal the author here? Joining us now live from the White House with more, CNN White House reporter Jeremy Diamond, where does the search stand now, Jeremy?', 'Well Victor, it really was a one two punch for the President. First we saw the book from Bob Woodward, a new bombshell book that really depicts the President, questioning his fitness to lead and showing that administration officials throughout government are trying to check his worst impulses. And then we see this Op-Ed from an anonymous senior administration official describing many of those very same qualities and describing the resistance inside the Trump administration. All of this has led to the President being very angry about this, fuming to aides about it and urging them to launch a search to uncover the identity of this senior administration official. But now the President is also calling on the Attorney General Jeff Sessions to launch an investigation into this Op-Ed and it\'s really is a serious escalation of what we\'ve seen so far from the White House. There has been no crime that the President has identified to warrant such an investigation and it\'s really raising questions about potential abuse of power if the President were to engage in this. And that is the very notion that The New York Times raised in a statement rebutting the President\'s comments saying, ""We\'re confident that the Department of Justice understands that the First Amendment protects all American citizens and that it would not participate in such a blatant abuse of government power."" But Kellyanne Conway, Counsel to the President, told our colleague Christiane Amanpour, just yesterday that she doesn\'t believe an investigation is warranted and she said she believes the individual will suss themselves out.', ""I'm not interested in an investigation. This I guess those who are investigating, great. I really hope they will find the person. I believe the person will suss himself or herself out though because that's usually what happens. People brag to the wrong person. They brag that they did this or they did that because I assume part of this, isn't the goal here not what the Op-Ed pretends the goal is for sure, isn't the goal here really to try to sow chaos and get us all suspicious of each other --"", ""Is that what's happening? Are you all getting suspicious of each other?"", ""No, that isn't what happened..."", ""That paranoia by the way and those suspicions are very real inside this West Wing this week, following this Op-Ed and launching just the latest search for leakers that we've seen inside this White House. But for now, we are still waiting for the President to speak to see if he's going to comment further today. He has no public events on his schedule. But we'll certainly be keeping an eye on his Twitter feed."", 'We certainly will, Jeremy Diamond at the White House, thank you.', 'So one of the questions here is, can the Justice Department investigate this? Michael Moore, Former U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, with us now and Brian Stelter, CNN Senior Media Correspondent and host of ""Reliable Sources."" Gentlemen, thank you so much. Michael Moore, first to you, can they, should they, would it do any good?', ""The Justice Department would typically investigate if there was a question about classified information being leaked out. That doesn't seem to be the case here. I think what you see though is that Trump just cannot get through his head, the DOJ is not his own personal KGB, and we don't sic them on people who disagree with the President or disagree with him. And he's never quite been able to understand that. It's rich to me that he suggests an investigation at this point, especially since he contends that when we got his son and his son-in-law and his senior advisers and him even in the Oval office meeting with Russian operatives. And that we're calling a witch hunt, but here he wants to seek the DOJ and talk about it being national security, and wants to put them on some kind of chase after somebody who has come out against him. At the end of the day, what you might find, this is something to just kind of tuck away in the back of your memory is that you may find this somewhere closer to the tops of the administration, it wouldn't surprise me at all to find out that somebody in the Vice President's camp looking to the next step after we see Kavanaugh confirmed. If that happens which it looks like it might happen. I think at that point, they'll be through with Trump, they've got no other reason to have him there. You might see people trying to topple him from the inside at that point."", 'Brian, do you, I mean you have all kind of friends at The New York Times. What are they saying to you about where they think this is going?', 'This op-ed is well over 12 million pages at this point. It\'s the number one story on the website for several days now. It\'s been shared all over social media. It\'s just astonishing to see the spread of this piece and the impact it\'s had. Given that on one level, the claims in the piece have been out there for many months. What is said in the op-ed lines up what\'s been reported by our colleagues and by ""The Times"" and by ""The Post"" ever since Inauguration Day that the President doesn\'t really know what he\'s doing. And according to the Bob Woodward book, some of his aides think he\'s a threat to national security. These are terrifying claims and yet the op-ed I think brought them to light in a new way, because it\'s all in the voice of this anonymous official, and because the official says, there are a lot of other people like him or her, that there are many people among this so- called resistance. So I was a little bit amused to hear the op-ed, I heard ""The New York times"" say, we didn\'t think it was going to be this big a deal. Because on one level that\'s true, this was not surprising on that level, but it is remarkable to see it all said in a single op-ed. I think that\'s why it\'s still driving conversations, still driving people\'s fears as we head into the weekend.', 'Well I mean, it does bring to question of what would compel somebody at this point in time to do this? I want to read what Nikki Haley wrote, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. in her own op-ed. She wrote, ""as a Former Governor, I find it absolutely chilling to imagine that a high ranking member of my team would secretly try to thwart my agenda. That is not the American way, it\'s fundamentally disloyal not just to the Chief Executive, but to our country and to our values, it is cowardly."" On the other end of the spectrum, you\'ve got Norm Eisen, Senior fellow of Brookings Institute, and he was an ethics czar to Former President Obama. In a CNN opinion piece, he writes this about anonymous, he says, the acts don\'t appear to be illegal, it doesn\'t meet the level of treason as President Trump asserts. And he writes, ""I believe the author is doing the ethical thing in resisting Trump from within and writing about it openly."" He called anonymous ""an American hero."" What is anonymous, Brian? Hero or coward?', ""Oh, in this country there are several ways to blow the whistle when you believe that there is wrong-doing happening. Normally you would come out publicly and speak with your own name attached or you would go to a reporter and be interviewed by the reporter. I think the senior officials found a new path where they're trying to speak in their own words but not have their name attached. But I do think, we should view it in one way as blowing the whistle, trying to draw attention to a crisis that is continuing to unfold. At least, that's how the person views him or herself. You know I think the key line of the piece is there are adults in the room. Don't worry, everybody, there are adults in the room trying to protect the U.S. from the President, so this person clearly believes that they are a hero."", 'So let me push back just for a second, Brian, and ask, what do we know about the validity of what this person is writing?', ""The Times says it did fact-check the piece, it did try to fact check the claims in the piece. For example, the claim about how there were whispers in the cabinet about invoking the 25th Amendment. But the reality is that when it's an opinion article as this is, an op-ed, there's only so much fact-checking that can go on. The Times did have direct communication with the writer, so they did verify the person's identity. Remember, we don't know the person but The Times editors do know who the person is. But with regards to being able to verify the claim, let's take one specific example, the claim that there are many dozens of others who have shared the same feelings. I think it would have been very, very difficult for The Times to try to verify that."", 'So OK, Michael, what are your thoughts on that?', ""Let me say first, in my law practice, I represent whistle- blowers every day. And to me this guy or lady is a hero. I never like to see things just come out anonymous in a paper, but they're a hero for at least telling us what's going on from the inside. I wish that we could have some of that courage seep over to the Congress where it seems there's been a total abdication of the constitutional duties of the Congress.
