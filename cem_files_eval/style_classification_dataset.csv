"Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. So the fact of the matter is that if I have occasionally mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush. Now, you've shown independence, commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example. And I give you enormous credit for that. But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you are proposing is eight more years of the same thing.",0

Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself.,1
"I know the press likes to focus on the body language and he's got that kind of slouch, looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom.",0
"We all know this is urgent. And unfortunately, over the course of the year, despite all the hearings that took place and all the negotiations that took place and people on both sides of the aisle worked long and hard on this issue, and you know, this became a very ideological battle. It became a very partisan battle, and politics, I think, ended up trumping practical common sense.",0

With profound gratitude...,0
"I mean, she wasn't like her face stayed the same.",1

"We just saw the Ferguson report come out. I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident.

"We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.",0
"There have been a handful of African-American leaders who've been critical. They were critical when I was running for president.

There's nothing serious about a plan that claims to reduce the deficit by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.

"With me, they're dealing with somebody that's a little bit different. They can't toy with me like they toy with everybody else. So let them have their debate and let's see how they do with the ratings.",1
"Thanksgiving reminds us that no matter our differences, we're still one people part of something bigger than ourselves.",0

"We're doing some bits that are, I think, going to be terrific.",1
"John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003. And at that time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong. You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong.

Put in the museum. Let it go.,1
"I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear --",0
"My concern is is that if we do that, then we're essentially back on Fox News or MSNBC on the split screen just arguing back and forth.

That I will faithfully execute.,0
It's a pigsty and I say get your house clean.,1

I'm going to do very restrained if I use it at all. I'm going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's where it's at.,1
The agreements and memoranda that we reached I think reflect the seriousness with which both of us take the climate change issue.,0
"And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.",0

"You know, look - it's not perfect, but it is the right size, it is right scope. Broadly speaking, it has for right priorities to create jobs that will jump-start our economy and transform this economy for the 21st century.",0
We can't stand him anymore. But I'm going to be here anyway 'cause we have to win.,1
"Let's see how much money Fox is going to make on the debate without me, OK?",1
There's a lot of talk in Washington these days about creating jobs. But it doesn't help when those same folks turn around and risk losing hundreds of thousands of jobs just because of political gamesmanship. We need to pass this transportation bill and put people to work rebuilding America.,0
"Ted's got a big problem. Other people have different problems. Me, I have no problems, you know?",1
How can Hillary manage this country when she can't even manage her emails?,1

I would say I see a person that's 35 years old.,1
"To those who would tear the world down, we will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security, we support you.

They need all the love and support from our American family as they grapple with an unimaginable loss.,0
"I think this year the Coast Guard maybe in terms of increase branding. The brand of the Coast Guard has been something incredible, what's happened.

I want shutters on the outside.,1

"This isn't the same country. When I hear that just happened - just happened - it literally just happened, and I think it's not so good. It's just - it's just an indication of where the hell we're going. I mean, hopefully they get released - and fast.",1
"Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. More than party affiliation, I vote based on what I believe is right for my family and for my country.",1

And so it's a very practical way of thinking about these problems. It's not either/or. It's a recognition that the prime driver of economic growth and jobs is going to be our people and the private sector and our businesses. But you know what? Government can help. Government can make a difference.,0
Give me a break.,1
The office of president of the United States.,0
"I think what's absolutely true is is that core commitments that we make to the most vulnerable have to be maintained. And so, a lot of the spending cuts that we're making should be around areas like defense spending, as opposed to food stamps.",0

"Actually, you're only entitled to half.",1
"I think what's going to be useful is for us to go through, you know, the issues that Republicans have issues on. Not sort of talking generally, but let's talk specifics, you know. This particular provision, when it comes to preexisting conditions, is something you're for or you're against? Helping seniors get their prescription drugs, does that make sense or not?",0

It's good psychology.,1
You've given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall.,1
"I have been opposed to Obamacare from the day they conceived it, and Ted Cruz comes out with an ad that I'm in favor of Obamacare - can you believe this? - just like he did with Carson, where Carson, he said, left Iowa.

One of the important roles that Poland can play is not just as a promoter of ideas but as a living example of what is possible when countries take reform seriously.,0

Wow.,1
I'm going to go for the classic mint chocolate chip.,0
"Many of our allies and partners have already stepped forward with commitments of troops and funding so that we can keep strengthening Afghan forces through the end of this decade.

"-- just keep that in mind. Now, we are here for one purpose, we want to make sure more young people have the chance to earn a higher education. And in the 21st century economy we all understand it's never been more important. The good news is that our economy is steadily growing and strengthening after the worst recession in a generation. So we've created more than 8 million new jobs, manufacturing is growing led by a booming auto industry. Thanks to some key public investments in advances like affordable energy and, you know, research and development, what we've seen is not only an energy revolution in this country that bodes well for our future, but in areas like health care for example we've slowed the growth of health care costs in ways that a lot of people wouldn't have anticipated as recently as five or 10 years ago. So there are a lot of good things going on in the economy. And businesses are starting to invest. In fact, what we're seeing are businesses overseas starting to say instead of outsourcing let's source back into the U.S. All that bodes well for our future. Here's the thing though, we don't grow just for the sake of growth. We grow so that it translates into a growing middle class, people getting jobs, people being able to support their families and people being able to pass something on to the next generation. We want to restore the essential promise of opportunity and upward mobility that's at the heart of America. The notion that if you work hard, you can get ahead. You can improve your situation in life. You can make something of yourself. That the same essential story Troy so eloquently told about himself. And the fact is it's been getting harder to do that for a lot of people. It is harder for folks to start in one place and move up that ladder. And that was true long before the recession hit. And that's why I've said that in 2014 we have to consider this a year of action, not just to grow the economy, not just to increase GDP, not just to make sure that corporations are profitable and the stock market's doing well and the financial system is stable. We've also got to make sure that that growth is broad based and everybody has a chance to access that growth and take advantage of it. We've got to make sure that we're creating new jobs and that the wages and benefits that go along with those jobs can support a family. We have to make sure that there are new ladders of opportunity in the middle class and that those ladders, the rungs on those ladders are solid and accessible for more people. Now, I'm going to be working with Congress where I can to accomplish this. But I'm also going to act on my own if Congress is deadlocked. I've got a pen to take executive actions where Congress won't. And I've got a telephone to rally folks around the country on this mission. And today is a great example of how without a whole bunch of new legislation we can advance this agenda. We've got philanthropists and business leaders here. We've got leaders of innovative non for profits, we've got college presidents from state universities and historically black colleges to Ivy League universities and community colleges. And today more than 100 colleges and 40 organizations are announcing new commitments to help more young people not only go to but graduate from college. And that's an extraordinary accomplishment. And we didn't pass a bill to do it. Everybody here is participating, I believe, because you know that college graduation has never been more valuable than it is today. Unemployment for Americans with a college degree is more than a third lower than the national average, incomes twice as high as those without a high school diploma. College is not the only path to success. We've got to make sure that more Americans of all age are getting the skills that they need to access the jobs that are out there right now. But more than ever a college degree is the surest path to a stable middle class life. And higher education speaks to something more than that. The premise that we're all created equal is the opening line in our American story, and we don't promise equal outcomes. We strive to deliver equal opportunity. The idea that success does not depend on being born in a wealth of privilege, depends on effort and merit.",0

", PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES Good afternoon, everybody. Please be seated. Dobry den. After many meetings around the world, I am delighted to welcome my friend and partner, President Medvedev, to the White House. This is also an opportunity to return the wonderful hospitality that the president, Mrs. Medvedeva, and the Russian people showed me and my family during our visit to Moscow one year ago. Michelle and I enjoyed a wonderful evening at the president's home. Our daughters will never forget having tea in the winter garden of the Kremlin. And, Mr. President, I hope you'll remember having a burger at Ray's Hell Burger today. We just concluded some excellent discussions, discussions that would have been unlikely just 17 months ago. As we've both said before, when I came into office, the relationship between the United States and Russia had drifted, perhaps to its lowest point since the Cold War. There was too much mistrust and too little real work on issues of common concern. That did not serve the interests of either country or the world. Indeed, I firmly believe that America's most significant national security interests and priorities could be advanced most effectively through cooperation, not an adversarial relationship with Russia. That's why I committed to resetting the relationship between our two nations. And in President Medvedev, I've found a solid and reliable partner. We listen to one another, and we speak candidly. So, Mr. President, I am very grateful for your leadership and your partnership. By any measure, we have made significant progress and achieved concrete results. Together, we negotiated and signed the historic New START Treaty, committing our nations to significant reductions in deployed nuclear weapons. Today, we reaffirmed our commitment to work to ratify this treaty as soon as possible so it can enter into force and set the stage for further cuts and cooperation. Together, we've strengthened the global nonproliferation regime, so that as we meet our obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, other nations meet theirs and are held accountable if they don't. Along with our international partners, we passed and are enforcing new U.N. sanctions against North Korea. We offered Iran the prospect of a better future, and when they refused, we joined with Russia and our partners on the Security Council to impose the toughest sanctions ever faced by the government of Iran. Together, our nations have deepened our cooperation against violent extremism, as terrorists threaten both our people, be it in Times Square or in Moscow. And today, we've agreed to expand our cooperation on intelligence and counter terrorism. Russian transit routes now play a vital role in supplying American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. And to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons, we came together at our nuclear security summit, where our two nations made numerous commitments, including agreeing to eliminate enough plutonium for about 17,000nuclear weapons. Together, we've coordinated our efforts to strengthen the global economic recovery through the G-20, work that we will continue in Toronto this weekend. And today we agreed to continue closely to coordinate our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts following the tragic outbreak of ethnic violence in Kyrgyzstan. Our two countries continue to disagree on certain issues, such as Georgia, and we addressed those differences candidly. But by moving forward in areas where we do agree, we have succeeded in resetting our relationship, which benefits regional and global security. This includes, I would note, a change in the attitudes among the Russian people, who today have a far more favorable view of the United States, and that in turn creates more space for additional partnership. Indeed, this has been the real focus of our work today and of President Medvedev's visit, not simply resetting our relationship, but also broadening it, because 20 years after the end of the Cold War, the U.S.-Russian relationship has to be about more than just security and arms control. It has to be about our shared prosperity and what we can build together. That's why we created the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission during my visit to Moscow last year to forge new partnerships, not just between governments, but between our businesses, our peoples, and our societies. And today, we agreed to forge new cooperation across a whole range of areas. In particular, we're expanding trade and commerce. We agreed to deepen our collaboration on energy efficiency and clean-energy technologies. And this afternoon, President Medvedev and I will join American and Russian business leaders as they move forward with a series of major trade and investment deals that will create jobs for Americans and Russians across many sectors, from aerospace and automotive engineering to the financial sector and high technology. Consistent with my administration's national export initiative, this includes the sale of 50 Boeing aircraft worth $4 billion that could add up to 44,000 new jobs in the American aerospace industry. To deepen Russia's integration into the global economy, I reaffirmed our strong commitment to Russia's ascension to the World Trade Organization. Today, we've reached an agreement that will allow the United States to begin exporting our poultry products to Russia once again. And I want to thank President Medvedev and his team for resolving this issue, which is of such importance to American business and which sends an important signal about Russia's seriousness about achieving membership in the WTO. Therefore, I told President Medvedev that our teams should accelerate their efforts to work together to complete this process in the very near future. Russia belongs in the WTO. That's good for Russia, it's good for America, and it's good for the world economy. I appreciated very much the opportunity to hear President Medvedev's vision for modernization in Russia, especially high-tech innovation as a personal passion of the president. And during his visit to Silicon Valley this week, he visited the headquarter of Twitters (sic), where he opened his own account. I have one, as well, so we may be able to finally throw away those red phones that have been sitting around for so long.",0

"The Republican leader of the House says: ""This is not a time for compromise."" That's a quote. The Republican leader in the Senate said his main goal for the next two years - his top priority is to win the next election and to beat me.",0
ISIS has spread. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. A refugee crisis threatens the West.,1
So I just want to tell you the campaign is doing really well. It's never been so well-united.,1

I mean with his bad policies - that's why ISIS came about.,1
"What the next president has to do, and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe, is to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.",0
"You can see the results here. Now, just because the houses are nice doesn't mean our job's done.",0
Nice to see you,1
There's no reason why we can't get that done. That is not a liberal idea or a conservative idea. It's not a Democratic or Republican idea. That is a smart idea. We want to keep those guns out of hands of folks who shouldn't have them.,0

"When that was a much different thing, Larry. I mean, Tara was having a problem and we're taking care of the problem. And I think it is going to work out great. But Miss Nevada was a disaster. The pictures were disgusting. They brought them up to my office today. I viewed them. And, you know, I've seen pictures before. You fully understand that, Larry, but these pictures were pretty far out there. And that is not representative of Miss USA. And it's not representative of Miss Nevada. We had no choice but to terminate her.",1
"If you become the president of the United States, Ms. Clinton, what about Ms. Clinton? Is she going to be your vice president?",0

Wow.,1

"Welcome back to this special edition of LARRY KING LIVE. I am here interviewing Larry instead of the other way around.

Which leads us to this question from director Quentin Tarantino.",1

"Faced with this violence, we wonder if the divides of race in America can ever be bridged. We wonder if an African-American community that feels unfairly targeted by police and police departments that feel unfairly maligned for doing their jobs can ever understand each other's experience.",0
"They say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that - where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK? It's, like, incredible.",1
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Why not?,1
I don't believe the polls anymore. I don't believe them.,1
"Because of how important this election is, I also want you to know that I am supporting Emmanuel Macron to lead you forward. En marche. Vive le France.",0
Either we win this election or we lose our country. And that's what's happening - that's your choice. It's as simple as that. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders.,1

Not.,1

I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws and to save lives and to let young people grow up. And that will require a change of politics on this issue.,0
"Hilary Clinton had the reset button. She wanted to get back together with Russia. She even spelled reset wrong, that's how it started and then it got worse. President Obama wanted to get along with Russia, but the chemistry wasn't there. Getting along with other nations is a good thing, not a bad thing, believe me. It's a good thing, not a bad thing.",1
"Yeah, I guess so. You know, I wish it was - I wish the first time it was done correctly.",1
You want to know the truth? I was going to say something extremely...,1
What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense.,1

Look at Japan. They sell cars. By the millions, they pour in. You know what we give them? Practically nothing, OK?",1
"We are running out of the traditional ammunition that's used in a recession, which is to lower interest rates. They're getting to be about as low as they can go.

"We've had such incredible support. Paul Ryan called me the other day, tremendous call. I spoke with Mitch McConnell today. We had a great conversation. The fact is we have to bring our party together. We have to bring it together.",1

We have no choice.,1
We're always fighting. We're the one that wants to go to World War III with Russia over Ukraine. So we're the ones always fighting. We're the ones putting up a lot of the money for NATO disproportionately - a lot.,1
But really it went nowhere and it was apparent that that wasn't what the meeting was actually about.,1

"You know, one of the pleasures of being president is scouting out places that you want to come back to, where you don't have to spend all your time in a conference room. The setting is breath-taking. Our German friends have been absolutely wonderful, and the success of this summit is a tribute their outstanding work. G7 represents some of the largest economies in the world, but in our G7 partners, the United States also embraces some of our strongest allies and closest friends in the world, so even as we work to promote the growth that creates jobs and opportunity, we're also here to stand up for the fundamental principles that we share as democracies for freedom, for peace, for the right of nations and peoples to decide their own destiny, for universal human rights and the dignity of every human being, and I'm pleased that here in Krun, we showed that on the most pressing global challenges, America and our allies stand united. We agree that the best way to sustain the global economic recovery is by focusing on jobs and growth. That's what I'm focused on in the United States. On Friday we learned that our economy created another 280,000 jobs in May, the strongest month of the year so far, and more than three million new jobs over the past year, nearly the fastest pace in over a decade. We've now seen five straight years of private sector job growth, 12.6 million new jobs created, the longest streak on record. The unemployment is near its lowest level in seven years. Wages for American workers continue to rise, and since I took office, the United States has cut our deficit by two-thirds, so in the global economy, America is a major source of strength. At the same time, we recognize that the global economy, while growing, is still not performing at its full potential, and we agreed on a number of necessary steps. Here in Europe, we support efforts to find a path that enables Greece to carry out key reforms and return to growth within a strong, stable, and growing Eurozone. I updated my partners on our effort with Congress to fast trade promotion authority so we can move ahead with TPP in the Asia Pacific region and TTIP here in Europe. Agreements with high standards to protect workers, public safety and the environment. We continue to make progress toward a strong global climate agreement this year in Paris. All the G7 countries have now put forward our post-2020 targets for reducing carbon emissions and will continue to urge other significant emitters to do so as well. We'll continue to meet our climate finance commitments to help developing countries to transition to low-carbon growth. As we've done in the US, the G7 agreed on the need to integrate climate risks into development assistance and investment programs across the board, and to increase access to risk insurance to help developing countries respond to and recover from climate-related disasters, and building on the Power Africa initiative I launched two years ago, the G7 will work to mobilize more financing for clean energy projects in Africa. With respect to security, the G7 remains strongly united in support for Ukraine. We'll continue to provide economic support and technical assistance that Ukraine needs as it moves ahead on critical reforms to transform its economy and strengthen its democracy. As we've seen again in recent days, Russian forces continue to operate in Eastern Ukraine, violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Now, this is now the second year in a row that the G7 has met without Russia, another example of Russia's isolation, and every member of the G7 continues to maintain sanctions on Russia for its aggression against Ukraine. Now, it's important to recognize the Russian economy has been seriously weakened. The Ruble and foreign investment are down. Inflation is up. The Russian Central Bank has lost more than $150 billion in reserves. Russian banks and firms are virtually locked out of the international markets. Russian energy companies are struggling to import the services and technologies they need for complex energy projects. Russian defense firms have been cut off from key technologies. Russia is in deep recession, so Russia's actions in Ukraine are hurting Russia and hurting the Russian people. Here at the G7, we agreed that even as we will continue to seek a diplomatic solution, sanctions against Russia will remain in place so long as Russia continues to violate its obligations under the Minsk Agreements. Our European partners reaffirmed that they will maintain sanctions on Russia until the Minsk agreements are fully implemented, which means extending the EU's existing sectorial sanctions beyond July, and the G7 is making it clear that if necessary, we stand ready to impose additional significant sanctions against Russia. Beyond Europe, we discussed the negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, and we remain united heading into the final stages of the talks. Iran has a historic opportunity to resolve the international community's concerns about its nuclear program, and we agreed that Iran needs to seize that opportunity. Our discussions with Prime Minister Al-Abadi of Iraq, President Caid Essebsi of Tunisia and President Buhari of Nigeria, were a chance to address the threats of ISIL and Boko Haram. The G7 countries, therefore, agreed to work together and with our partners to further coordinate our counter-terrorism efforts. As many of the world's leading partners in global development joined by leaders of Ethiopia, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and the African Union, we discussed how to maximize the impact of our development partnerships. We agreed to continue our landmark initiative to promote food security and nutrition, part of our effort to lift 500 million people into developing countries out of hunger and malnutrition by 2030. We'll continue to work with our partners in West Africa to get ebola cases down to zero, and as part of our global health security agenda, I'm pleased that the G7 made a major commitment to help 60 countries over the next five years achieve specific targets to better prevent, detect, and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics. And, finally, I want to commend Chancellor Merkel for ensuring that this summit included a focus on expanding educational and economic opportunities for women and girls. The G7 committed to expanding career training for women in our own countries and to increase technical and vocational training in developing countries which will help all of our nations prosper. So, again, I want to thank Angela and the People of Germany for their extraordinary hospitality. I leave here confident that when it comes to the key challenges of our time, America and our closest allies stand shoulder-to-shoulder, so with that, I will take some questions, and I will start off with Jeff Mason of Reuters.",0
The main message I have is that the statistics every day underscore the urgency of the economic situation. The American people expect action.,0

I'm worth many billions of dollars, it's very simple. She said I was bankrupt. Now, I never went bankrupt. She said I filed bankruptcy three times. I never filed bankruptcy.

This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub.
