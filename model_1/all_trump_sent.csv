Hillary Clinton...
...And her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy.
She's trigger happy and very unstable.
"Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions and only hatred and derision."
Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color...
...Only as votes.
"Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. I think I am a nice person. People that know me like me."
"They say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that - where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK? It's, like, incredible."
Thank you very much.
You do right every day by your community and your families. You raise children in the light of God. I will always support your church - always - and defend your right to worship.
"We're going to bring jobs back. I will have a chance - thank you. We'll bring them back. Taking them back from Mexico and everywhere else because they're gone. I will have a chance to discuss school choice, which is very important, and how to put every American on the ladder to success - a great education and a great job."
"See, most groups I speak to don't know that, but we know it. If you want, we can say it..."
"...Very much, good luck."
"...You, too. Watch that bee."
I loved it.
The GOP is the party of Abraham Lincoln.
And I want our party to be the home of the African-American voter once again.
"We need new leadership. We need new thinking. We need strength. We need, in our country, law and order."
"And if I'm elected president, that will happened."
China is killing us. Japan is killing us. Vietnam - new one - killing us.
"If we can win here, if we win in Iowa - everyone's talking about it - we can run the table for the first time ever."
I have to say this. Don't be insulted. You haven't had a winner in 16 years.
Who was not born on U.S. soil. It's a problem.
"Ted's got a big problem. Other people have different problems. Me, I have no problems, you know?"
"They just came out with the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll. And the numbers were so good for me, which I'm happy about."
Certainly I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong. But you may have groups in there...
"...That are totally fine, and it would be very unfair. So give me a list of the groups, and I'll let you know."
"I don't know anything - honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I've ever met him. I'm pretty I didn't meet him, and I just don't know anything about him."
"I've studied this issue in great detail, I would say actually greater by far than anybody else."
"Believe me. Oh, believe me."
My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.
"Just so you understand, Ted Cruz, I don't know if he likes me or if he doesn't like me. But he is one hell of a competitor. He is a tough, smart guy."
And he has got an amazing future. He has got an amazing future. So I want to congratulate Ted.
We're going after Hillary Clinton. She will not...
"...She will not be a great president. She will not be a good president. She will be a poor president. She doesn't understand trade. Her husband signed, perhaps in the history of the world, the single worst trade deal ever done. It's called NAFTA. And I was witness to the carnage."
"But they said just as I was coming and I'm watching and watching the news and they said, well, at our rallies, we would never have it anything like that. They don't have any people at their rallies, folks. There's nobody there. Nobody cares."
(As Donald Trump doll) This one's easy for me. You're fired.
(As Donald Trump doll) Never give up under any circumstances. Never give up.
"They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."
"This is a case I could've settled very easily, but I don't settle cases very easily when I'm right."
Oftentimes they're working two jobs.
"So they're working harder, they're older and they're making less. It's like me, I'm working harder than I've ever worked also. But these are minor - nobody cares about that. That's - who cares about that?"
We have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries. We take care of them better than we take care of ourselves.
They have been forgotten. We are not going to forget them. They have built our country. We will not forget.
"You know, cyber is becoming so big today. It's becoming something that a number of years ago - a short number of years ago wasn't even a word. And now the cyber is so big. And you know, you look at what they're doing with the Internet, how they're taking, recruiting people through the Internet."
"And part of it is the psychology because so many people think they're winning. And you know, there's a whole big thing, even today's psychology where CNN came out with a big poll. Their big poll came out today that Trump is winning. It's good psychology."
It's good psychology.
Let's have a big win in Nevada. Let's have a big win at the SEC. Let's put this thing away.
They know that he was bad. They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad. But you know what? They didn't turn him in.
It's been some unbelievable day and evening and year. And I never have been through anything like this. But it's a beautiful thing to watch and a beautiful thing to behold. And we're going to make America great again.
So we're going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction. They will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS.
We have no choice.
Ridiculous...
"You know, in the old days, it was great. Right now we have bigger problems. You understand that. We've got to fix our potholes. You know, we don't have exactly a lot of money."
I love NASA. I love what it represents. I love what it stands for. And I hope that someday in the not-too-distant future we can get that going. Space is terrific.
"Let's start off by saying Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas."
"They're very dishonest. They have written very dishonestly about all of us. It's a movement like they've never seen before. And yet we won, folks. We won, right?"
"You know, the media was saying, the people that are negotiating your trade deals are very rich. I said, but isn't that what we want?"
"And they said, why is it that the people protecting our border are generals? Because that's what we want. We want generals. We want generals."
"They're not so deplorable anymore. In fact, the other side's trying to figure out, well, in four years, how do we get some of these deplorable to our side, right?"
"Yes, because it happens to be one of the strongest assets."
"Also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period - we're going to..."
"We're going to very much try and keep that in. Adds cost, but it's very much something we're going to try and keep."
"Thank you, folks. You know this is where it all began - New Hampshire."
How can Hillary manage this country when she can't even manage her emails?
She did things where - and we have our trial. You have to go - but - what - she's guilty. She's guilty.
"And by the way, I didn't have to bring J-Lo or Jay-Z - the only way she gets anybody."
I'm here all by myself. I am here all by myself.
We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.
We're ready. Let's go. Make me a soap star.
OK. Absolutely. Melania said this was OK.
"Then, all of a sudden, I see her. She's now got the big, phony [expletive] and everything. She's totally changed her look."
"You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful - I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet."
"Just kiss - I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything."
"First of all, it was rigged. And I'm afraid the election's going to be rigged. I have to be honest."
It's a crooked system. It's a rigged system. We're running against a rigged system. And we're running against a very dishonest media.
"When we run, we have to make sure that you don't have people voting 10 times."
The deaths of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota also make clear how much more work we have to do to make every American feel that their safety is protected.
We're going to put the miners back to work. We're going to put the miners back to work.
The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment.
"Yeah, there has be some form."
Wisconsin is very important. It's becoming more and more important.
"We have a right to speak. I mean, we are law-abiding people. We're people that work very hard. We're people that have built this country and made this country great. And we're all together. And we want to get along with everybody, but when they have organized, professionally staged wise-guys, we've got to fight back. We've got to fight back."
"Trump is best on ISIS. Trump is best on military. Trump is best on security. Yeah, don't hurt him. Don't hurt him."
"And he referred to my hands. If they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you."
He couldn't get elected dog catcher.
"I guess we're allowed to make speeches with absolutely no sleep, is that right? Are we?"
"Ted Cruz may not be a U.S. citizen, right? But he's an anchor baby. No, he's an anchor baby. Ted Cruz is an anchor baby in Canada."
"As Republicans, if you think you're going to change very substantially for the worse Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security in any substantial way, and at the same time, you think you're going to win elections, it just really is not going to happen."
"She gets out, and she starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions. And, you know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever."
Wow.
Thank you very much. And he did very well with...
"You can be out front, you can be the spearhead, you can do whatever you want to do, but every one of those 11 million people will be voting Democratic. It's just the way it works. And you have to be very, very careful."
"You know, I win. I win. In life, I win. I want to win. I have a very winning temperament. OK?"
We're going into what they used to call Democrat strongholds where we're now either tied or leading. We're going to Minnesota.
I enjoy speaking to all of you in Pennsylvania so much I decided to do it again.
And the media was so nice to me after. I just had to come back.
"By the way, folks, while we're at it, great..."
Nobody said it was going to be easy for us.
"But we will never be stopped, never ever be stopped."
We will make America great again. God bless you and good night.
They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.
That's for sure.
"And I'm telling you, November 8, we better be careful because that election's going to be rigged."
"We all got tired of seeing what was happening. And we wanted change, but we wanted real change."
You do right every day by your community and your families. You raise children in the light of God. I will always support your church - always - and defend your right to worship.
"As far as hacking, I think it was Russia."
"Well, Russia - but you know what? - could have been others also."
I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals in Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we've stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia.
"Thank you very much. It's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on a almost daily basis. I think we probably, maybe won the nomination because of news conferences, and it's good to be with you."
We stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news.
"I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public. As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they're going to suffer the consequences. They already are."
"Go ahead. Go ahead. No, not you. Not you. Your organization's terrible."
"Don't be rude. No, I'm not going to give you a - I am not going to give you a question. You are fake news."
"It's a Jack Nicklaus signature course, and it's a great, great resort and place. And we have a lot of our members here, I see. And..."
...We love our members.
"It is now my honor and privilege to welcome to the stage your next secretary of defense, General Mad Dog Mattis."
"Once they hack, if you don't catch them in the act you're not going to catch them. They have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace."
You're fired.
Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."
They have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace.
We are going to appoint Mad Dog Mattis...
...As our secretary of defense.
"But we're not announcing it till Monday, so don't tell anybody."
"On regulation, I will formulate a rule which says that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated - so important."
"These lenders aren't babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet, little people that you think, OK?"
"We are going to have the best of the best. And honestly, if you don't learn from them, if you don't learn from me, if you don't learn from the people that we're going to be putting forward - and these are all people that are hand-picked by me - then you're just not going to make it in terms of the world of success."
"I pick up - I'm picking up now - I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I'm not saying I love it, but it does get the word out."
I'm going to do very restrained if I use it at all. I'm going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's where it's at.
We will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.
Have to do it.
"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and - have criminal records - gang members, drug dealers. We have a lot of these people, probably 2 million. It could even be 3 million. We are getting them out of our country or we're going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country. They're here illegally."
She talks tough. She talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn't even know who the rebels are.
I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton.
"She congratulated us - it's about us - on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she - she fought very hard."
"Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely."
"And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning."
We're going to get to work immediately for the American people.
"Right now, she is being protected by a rigged system. It's a totally rigged system. I've been saying it for a long time. You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days. You can't do it, folks."
Where did you find - where did you find this?
Where did you find it?
"Oh, really?"
"OK, OK, good."
Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don't come in and vote five times.
I don't believe the polls anymore. I don't believe them.
A lot of good polls out there today. We just got one. We're 7 up in North Carolina - 7 up.
We're sort of way up everywhere.
Horrible people. Untruthful people.
"And yet, we're leading. With all of the dishonesty, we're leading. And I think we're leading big. And I think on Nov. 8, it'll even be bigger."
"Obamacare is just blowing up. And even the White House, our president, announced 25 or 26 percent. That number is so wrong. That is such a phony number. You're talking about 60, 70, 80 percent in increases, not 25 percent."
"Obamacare has to be repealed and replaced, and it has to be replaced with something much less expensive for the people. And, otherwise, this country's in even bigger trouble than anybody thought."
Nobody has more respect for women than I do - nobody.
"Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both."
Which is a big mistake.
Such a nasty woman.
I did not say that.
I did not say that.
But did not say that.
"I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time. What I've seen - what I've seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt. And the pile-on is so amazing. The New York Times actually wrote an article about it - that they don't even care. It's so dishonest, and they've poisoned the minds of the voters. But unfortunately for them..."
"Tell you one other thing - she shouldn't be allowed to run. It's crook - she's guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run. And just in that respect, I say it's rigged because she should never..."
"Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with emails and so many other things."
What I'm saying...
...Is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?
I will look at it at that time. I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time.
Thanks.
What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense.
"I didn't know any of these women. I didn't see these women. These women - the woman on the plane, the - I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it's her campaign."
"We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania, and you see what they're doing to the people - miners and others - in the energy business."
So foreign bureaucrats are going to be controlling what we're using and what we're doing on our land in our country? No way.
And a poll just came out - Wall Street Journal/NBC - we're leading Ohio by 1 or 2 points. But we're going to win Ohio.
Either we win this election or we lose our country. And that's what's happening - that's your choice. It's as simple as that. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders.
Here's an interesting one - Sidney Blumenthal.
So Blumenthal writes a quote - this just come out a little while ago. I have to tell you this.
"Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect the United States personnel."
"The attack was almost certainly preventable, Benghazi. Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect the United States personnel at an American consulate in Libya. He meant Benghazi. If the GOP wants to raise that as a talking point against her, it is legitimate. In other words, she's now admitting that they could have done something about Benghazi. This just came out a little while ago."
"There simple but very beautiful words - are you ready? Jobs, jobs, jobs."
"You look at African-American youth with unemployment rates in the 50s. And I say to people, the poverty is at numbers that you wouldn't believe. And I say, what do you have to lose? I'll fix it."
I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do. I said...
"I said things that - frankly, you hear these things. They're said. And I was embarrassed by it, but I have tremendous respect for women..."
"...And women have respect for me. And I will tell you - no, I have not. And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe. We're going to have borders on our country, which we don't have now."
From the United States Congress.
"Oh, you didn't delete them? You didn't delete them?"
"Over 33,000? Yeah, right."
"Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?"
Because you have nothing to say.
And get off this question.
"No, I didn't say that at all. I don't think you understood what was said. This was locker-room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I'm not proud of it, but this is locker-room talk. You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have..."
Hundreds of thousands...
"TPP, the trade deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership, a horrible deal for our country."
"I've been saying from the beginning of this campaign how ridiculous, complex and, yes, unfair the tax system is. It is an unfair system and so complex that very few people understand it. Fortunately, I understand it."
I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit and to the benefit...
"...Of my company, my investors and my employees. I mean, honestly, I have brilliantly used those laws."
"And when people make the mistake of underestimating me, that's when they are really in for their biggest surprise."
"Yeah, I guess so. You know, I wish it was - I wish the first time it was done correctly."
"We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country. The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button - they pressed the wrong button. Or perhaps, worse than that, it was corruption. But these people that we were going to deport, for good reason, ended up becoming citizens - ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know."
I did not.
I do not say that.
Wrong.
You called it the gold standard.
You called it the gold standard of trade deals.
You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.
"And then you heard what I said about it. And all of a sudden, you were against it."
"Oh, yeah."
Not.
So is it President Obama's fault...
"No, you're wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor - our new mayor - refused to go forward with the case. They would have won her appeal. If you look at it throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed."
"No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and that are bad people that shouldn't have them."
"Almost every single poll had us winning the debate against crooked Hillary Clinton, big league - big league."
"I knew I was going into a situation where you were going to have one of the largest audiences in the history of television. And I took a deep breath, and I pretended I was talking to my family. It's very interesting. You just block it out."
"For 90 minutes, I watched her very carefully. And I was also holding back. I didn't want to do anything to embarrass her."
People who work hard but don't have a voice - I'm running to be their voice.
And to fight and bring prosperity to every part of this country.
"You got to see this guy, (mocking reporter) I don't know what I said. I don't remember."
"My opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the office of presidency. It's not even close. As secretary of state, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldn't take them back."
Thank you.
"But before we do, I want to briefly discuss new revelations about Hillary Clinton's very famous emails."
So I just wanted to set the record straight.
The Democratic Party has trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success.
The TPP is a horrible deal. It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble.
What do you have to lose? You're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?
"NAFTA was the worst trade deal in the history - it's, like, the history of this country."
"As reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs."
"Yet, Hillary Clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words radical Islam."
"I called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger. But now many are saying that I was right to do so. And although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. We have to do it. It will be lifted, this ban, when and as a nation, we're in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country."
"He's just a member of a club or society very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he's got bias. I want to build a wall."
Bring them home to mom. Go home to mommy. Go home to mommy.
"Sixteen people that are senators and governors and, you know, high-level people, and one by one they're gone."
We'll see what happens now. But I think Hillary actually will be easier to beat.
"We want to raise up to a billion dollars, maybe even over that. I'm not even sure that's necessary because I have a big voice. I go on shows like yours. I explain the truth. And people seem to go along with it."
"I would be interested in inviting John. I like John. I've had a good relationship with John. I've gotten along with him well. But John will, whether he's vice president or not, I think he'll be very, very helpful with Ohio."
"And the government, our government, our poor government, we're being out-dealt by China. They're so smart. But I make a lot of money with China. We're being out-dealt by China and Mexico and Japan. Look at Japan. They sell cars. By the millions, they pour in. You know what we give them? Practically nothing, OK?"
"The best way to beat the system is have evenings like this, where you get record-setting votes, where you get record-setting delegates."
"I use the analogy of the boxer, you know? When the boxer knocks out the other boxer, you don't have to wait around for a decision. So that's what it is. And that's what happened tonight."
"How do you pick a man on the second or third or fourth ballot who has millions of votes - Five, 6 million votes - Less than Trump? And I'm the one that brought all these people into the party. And you know what's going to happen?"
"Those people, at a minimum, they're going to be very upset, very angry. But at a minimum, they're just not going to vote."
"I'm not playing a part. Look, I started off with 17. I'm down, now I'm winning and it's over. As far as I'm concerned, it's over. These two guys cannot win. There is no path. So why would I change?"
"I called her crooked Hillary. She's crooked. She'll be a horrible president. She knows nothing about job creation. Her husband signed NAFTA, which destroyed this country economically. I will tell you."
"And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote. The only thing she's got going is the woman's card. And the beautiful thing is women don't like her, OK? And look how well I did with women tonight. OK."
Don't be...
We're not - I am not going to give you a question.
You are fake news.
"People that know me the best - the people of New York, where they give us this kind of a vote."
"My team has been amazing. And, you know, it's actually a team of unity. It's evolving, but people don't understand that."
"We don't have much of a race anymore, based on what I'm seeing on television. Sen. Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated."
"So we're going to celebrate for about two hours. Then, early in the morning, I get up, and we begin working again. Thank you, everybody, and thank you, New York. We love New York."
"If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability because we have a horrible relationship with Russia."
"It's all fake news. It's phony stuff. It didn't happen. And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know because you reported it and so did many of the other people. It was a group of opponents that got together, sick people, and they put that crap together."
"If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That's called an asset, not a liability."
"But will most likely be on the same day or the same week but probably the same day, could be the same hour."
"You know, when they said we're going to take the arena up in Buffalo, they said, oh, don't do that. It's a massive arena. Look at this place. Just take a look at this place - unbelievable."
"No New Yorker can vote for Ted Cruz. And no New Yorker can vote for Kasich when he was one that approved NAFTA. He voted in favor of NAFTA, which has been a disaster for your state and for this country."
"It's going to be interesting to see what happens because I'm saying that we're going to hit the 1,237, I believe."
"Because New York is looking great, but you got to go and vote."
"But I noticed any time anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians - she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking."
So we're going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction. They will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS.
We have no choice.
"NATO may be obsolete. NATO was set up a long time ago - many, many years ago when things were different."
We did this as a quickie. We wanted to come into this area. We're staying here tonight. And I know you have a baseball game and you have a big basketball game. We're going to go really quickly tonight. But we're going to say one thing - we're going to make America great again. Remember that.
"I watched President Obama talking about Gitmo - right? - Guantanamo Bay, which by the way - which by the way, we are keeping open, which we are keeping open."
"And we're going to load it up with some bad dudes. Believe me, we're going to load it up."
"No, I don't anyway. Look..."
"No, we'll see who it is."
I really want to win Wisconsin because...
And you probably saw what happened today with my campaign. He's a good guy - Corey.
"And by the way the easiest thing - Corey, you're fired. I can't do that - can't do it."
What did you think - right? Nothing. Women are so - what did you think? What did you...
"I mean, she wasn't like her face stayed the same."
"She said, I was jolted backwards. Was she jolted backwards?"
So Walker came out today. I wrote down notes about Wisconsin.
You have no choice. You got to go for Trump - Supreme Court justices.
"Look, Supreme Court Justice Scalia - great, was supposed to live for a long time. He died."
"We've had such incredible support. Paul Ryan called me the other day, tremendous call. I spoke with Mitch McConnell today. We had a great conversation. The fact is we have to bring our party together. We have to bring it together."
"We have - we have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world. Everybody's writing about it. All over Europe, all over the world they're talking about it. Millions of people are coming in to vote."
"Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people..."
"Sure - some are nice. Some are nice - some really disgusting people back there though, I have to tell you. And I just want to say we're going to go forward, and we're going to win. But more importantly, we're going to win for the country. We're going to win, win, win. And we're not stopping. We're going to have great victories for our country. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you."
"You know, the beauty would be if we win Florida and we win Ohio, we can go and attack Hillary. No more attacking each other."
"We're all in this together. We're going to come up with solutions. We're going to find the answers to things. And so far, I cannot believe how civil it's been up here."
"We have to obey the laws - OK, have to obey the laws. But we have to expand those laws because we have to be able to fight..."
"...On at least somewhat of an equal footing, or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad. We better expand our laws, or we're being a bunch of suckers and they are laughing at us. They are laughing at us. Believe me."
"There is some anger. There's also great love for the country. It's a beautiful thing in many respects, but I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake."
"We have some protesters who are bad dudes. They have done bad things. They are swinging. They are really dangerous. And they get in there, and they start hitting people. And we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people."
"I'm Donald Trump, and I approve this message."
Excuse me. Sit down. You weren't called. Sit down. Sit down.
Go back to Univision.
Does Mexico come here and build a plant in the United States? We lose a fortune with every deal we have.
"They didn't do so well tonight, folks, OK. I'm not going to say anybody didn't do well. They didn't do well. There's only one person did well tonight - Donald Trump. I will tell you. It's true."
"And I don't think I've ever had so many horrible, horrible things said about me in one week."
"Thirty-eight million dollars worth of horrible lies, but that's OK. It shows you how brilliant the public is."
They're having a revolution within the Teamsters because the men and people of the Teamsters want to vote for me. The leadership is always stuck with the Democrats. But the workers want to vote for Trump.
"He was a failed candidate. He should have beaten President Obama very easy. He failed miserably. And it was an embarrassment to everybody, including the Republican Party. He went away - it looked like he went away on a vacation the last month. So I don't take that. And I guess, obviously, he wants to be relevant. He wants to be back in the game."
"I have to say this. He hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I've never heard of this one. Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you, there's no problem. I guarantee it."
"Let me tell you the real con artist - excuse me.  The real con artist is Sen. Marco Rubio, who was elected in Florida and who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate.  He doesn't go to vote.  He's absent.  Now, the people of Florida can't stand him.  He couldn't get elected dog catcher.  The people of Florida..."
"Oh, stop it."
It's a minor case.
Excuse me.
It's a minor civil case.
Give me a break.
It's a minor civil case.
"There are many, many civil cases."
Give me a break.
Give me a break.
"They won't refuse. They're not going to refuse me, believe me."
"Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East, they're chopping off heads. And now we're talking about waterboarding. We should go for waterboarding, and we should go tougher than waterboarding."
"And I'm a leader. I'm a leader. I've always been a leader. I've never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, they're going to do it. That's what leadership is all about."
Even if it's not me?
"Yes - yes, I will."
I'm a good Christian. And I'm leading with evangelicals.
"So I told you they're chipping away at Christianity and they're chipping away at the Second Amendment. Every year - chip, chip, chip."
He holds up that Bible. And he's there with the Bible. And he puts it down and then he starts lying.
"Hopefully, they're going to run it properly. I'm sure they're going to run properly, but I'm not going to do deals. And I think, you know - I think that's going to be good."
"I turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest. It was..."
...Probably a billion dollars of deals that I turned down because...
"No, it's totally different. They're not president. I mean, they're not president. But they're not going to do it, either."
"I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country. And frankly I think they're putting it out, and it's ridiculous."
"They're not making deals, and they're going to run my company. I have a lot of property and great stuff. They're going to run it. They're going to run it. Hopefully they're going to run it properly. I'm sure they're going to run it properly. But I'm not going to do deals. And I think, you know, I think that's going to be good."
"I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China, could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on the bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?"
"I spoke to a very good man yesterday - the head of Boeing - terrific guy. And we're going to work it out, but, you know, that's what I'm here for. I'm going to negotiate prices. And its planes are too expensive, and we're going to get the prices down. And if we don't get the prices down, we're not going to order them."
"If they want to fire their workers, move to Mexico or some other country and sell their product into our country, they're going to be paying a tax."
"It's Georgia, Alabama, Massachusetts..."
...Tennessee.
The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
"They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people."
He's not a war hero.
He's a war hero...
"He's a war hero 'cause he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK? I hate to tell you."
Unbelievable. Thank you.
"You know, now I know how the great Billy Graham felt because this is the same feeling."
Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
"I am a unifier. I would love to see the Republican Party and everybody get together and unify. And when we unify, there is nobody - nobody that's going to beat us. Thank you very much."
"This has been an amazing evening. Already we've won five major states, and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine."
"Our party is expanding, and all you have to do is take a look at the primary states where I've won, and just look where we've gone from X number to a much larger number. That hasn't happened to the Republican Party in many, many decades. So I think we're going to be more inclusive, I think  we're going to be more unified, and I think we're going to be a much bigger party, and I think we're going to win in November."
"He is a lightweight as I've said many times before. But you know what? We're going to go to Florida, and we're going to spend so much time in Florida. We've got about a 20-point lead. I know that a lot of groups, a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want, they're going to put $20 or $25 billion into it over the next two weeks from what just came over the wires."
I've seen you. You're losing so badly you - I want to - you don't know what's happening.
I will let people die on the streets if I'm president.
Excuse me. Let me talk.
My plan is very simple.
"I mean, first of all, this guy's a choke artist, and this guy's a liar."
Nothing.
"So let me ask you this because you're really getting beaten badly. I know you're embarrassed. I know you're embarrassed, but keep fighting, Keep swinging, man. Swing for the fences."
New people are coming into the Republican Party. We are building a new Republican Party. A lot of new people are coming in.
We need to build a wall.
We need to keep illegals out.
"We're going to have a lot of phone calls made to companies when they say they're thinking about leaving this country because they're not leaving this country. They're not going to leave this country. And the workers are going to keep their jobs. And they can leave from state to state. And they can negotiate good deals with the different states and all of that. But leaving the country is going to be very, very difficult."
"Thank you, everybody. Wow, thank you."
Now the real work begins.
"You are the movement. I'm the messenger. I'm just really the messenger. Although I've been a very good messenger, let's face it, right? I've been a pretty good messenger."
"They kept saying there's no path and all this nonsense. So - and I go out and I see the people like this and I'd say, how are we going to lose?"
"If a company wants to still leave the state of Ohio or Pennsylvania - or how about North Carolina? How well did we do in North Carolina, right?"
"I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it. It's called delay, delay, delay."
"New Hampshire, I want to thank you. We love you."
"You started it. Remember, you started it."
Now that I got that over with...
"Congratulations to Bernie. In all fairness, we have to congratulate him. We may not like it."
"We wish him a lot of luck, but we are going to make America great again. But we're going to do it the old-fashioned way."
"We are going to start winning again. And we're going to win so much, you are going to be so happy. We are going to make America so great again - maybe greater than ever before."
I have never seen anything like it. It cannot be like this tomorrow. But I think it's going to be fine.
"You heard the other night at debate, they asked Ted Cruz - serious question - well, what do you think of waterboarding? Is it OK? And honestly, I thought he'd say absolutely. And he didn't. He said, well, it's..."
You're not allowed to say - and I never expect to hear that from you again. She said - I never expect to hear that from you again - she said he's a [expletive]. That's terrible.
"So I want to just tell you right now, ma'am, you're reprimanded, OK?"
"In declaring this national holiday, President Lincoln called upon Americans to speak with one voice and one heart. That's just what we have to do."
"Great competence, love of what they're doing, how they're getting along with people, references."
"That's so nice. Thank you, thank you, man. That is a as a vet. There's a vet. We love our vets."
"You have to stick up for your rights. When you're treated badly, you have to stick up for your rights."
You look at all the cameras - it's like the Academy Awards. This is like the Academy Awards.
"I was told by everybody, do not go to Iowa. You could never finish even in the top ten."
"And I said, but I have friends in Iowa. I know a lot of people in Iowa. I think they'll really like me. Let's give it a shot. They said, don't do it. I said, I have to do it."
"And we finished second, and I want to tell you something. I'm just honored. I'm really honored."
You have a guy like Ted Cruz who's nervous as can be. I looked at him the other day. He's a wreck. He's a nervous wreck. His polls are going down the tubes.
They can't toy with me like they toy with everybody else.
"When they sent out the wise guy press releases a little while ago done by some PR person along with Roger Ailes, I said, bye bye."
"Let's see how much money Fox is going to make on the debate without me, OK?"
"We're going to be properly led, and we're going to be so proud of our country. After a year, you're going to say, wow, that will happen, and it'll happen pretty quickly."
So I hope you can get out and caucus on February 1. And I love you all.
"Because now he's doing a little bit better. No, I didn't care before. It's true. No, it's true. Hey, look, he never had a chance. Now he's doing better. He's got probably a 4 or 5 percent chance."
"I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly, and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger."
"Our military is a disaster. Our health care is a horror show. Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people."
"And yes, I am angry."
So I'm here today to introduce the man who'll be my partner in this campaign and the White House to fix our rigged system.
"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records - gang members, drug dealers. We have a lot of these people - probably 2 million. It could even be 3 million. We're getting them out of our country, or we're going to incarcerate."
"Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future."
"I'll speak to you for, like, and hour, but we speak about current events. As an example, the boats got captured."
"This isn't the same country. When I hear that just happened - just happened - it literally just happened, and I think it's not so good. It's just - it's just an indication of where the hell we're going. I mean, hopefully they get released - and fast."
"Now, let's assume it's Hillary, even though she probably should be in prison, in all fairness."
The Democrats are going to bring a suit. And you can't run unless you're going to be - how can you run like that? You don't even know.
"We discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties."
I think he's the worst president maybe in the history of our country. I think he's been a disaster. He's been weak. He's been ineffective.
"I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel. He's - he explained some of the difficulties, some of the high-flying assets and some of the really great things that have been achieved."
"So, Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future."
On the first day of my term...
One day one...
On day one...
"On my first day, we're going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama."
"We will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall."
"Then I'm going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be canceled."
"On day one, I'm going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country."
"I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools. And you have to. And on military bases, my first day, it gets signed - OK? - my first day."
So it's going to be a very busy first day.
"Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division - have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people."
We are going to win the great state of North Carolina.
"Florida's my second home, a state I love so much."
This is it. This is it. Good luck. Get out there. I did my thing. I mean I worked.
"You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days. You can't do it, folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it. The FBI knows it. The people know it. And now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on Nov. 8."
"It's time to cut our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past. Hillary Clinton is the candidate of yesterday. We - you, you, we - are the movement of the future."
"They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists and some, I assume, are good people."
I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.
I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.
"I even brought my Bible, the evangelicals, OK? We love the evangelicals."
"It's the best. We love ""The Art Of The Deal."" But the Bible is far, far, far superior, right? Yes."
We can't stand him anymore. But I'm going to be here anyway 'cause we have to win.
"You've got to remember, in all fairness, to the best of my knowledge, not too many evangelicals come out of Cuba, OK? Just remember that."
"So February 1, get out and vote. Get out and vote. Thank you. Thank you, everybody."
What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense.
That I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election if I win.
I called Hillary a nasty woman.
"But this stuff is all relative. After listening to Hillary rattle on and on and on, I don't think so badly of Rosie O'Donnell anymore."
I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now.
So that's a good sign. That's a good sign because I honestly - I believe we're going to win. This is what's going to happen. This is what's going to happen.
"The level of excitement and the people coming out, I think we're going to have beyond Brexit. I think we'll go beyond Brexit. Do you know about Brexit?"
I am working on it. There's no doubt about it. I've got three stops today. We've got three of these today. We've got three.
"I will be happy with myself because I always say I don't want to think back, if only I did one more rally, I would have won North Carolina by 500 votes instead of losing it by 200 votes, right? If only I did - so I never want to ever look back. I never want to say that about myself."
I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election if I win.
The system is totally rigged and broken.
Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign - total fabrication.
All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.
With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall.
"We're going to get them out. We're going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date we'll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out."
"...In order to enrich these global financial powers, her special-interest friends and her donors."
"As you have seen, right now, I am being viciously attacked with lies and smears. It's a phony deal. I have no idea who these women are - have no idea. I have no idea."
Take a look. You take a look. Look at her. Look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don't think so.
"For them, it's a war. And for them, nothing at all is out of bounds. This is a struggle for the survival of our nation. Believe me. And this will be our last chance to save it. On November 8. Remember that."
The emails show that the Clinton machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to the media organizations that she - listen to this - is given the questions and answers in advance of her debate performance with Bernie Sanders.
Job doesn't really believe I'm unhinged. He said that very simply because he has failed in this campaign. It's been a total disaster. Nobody cares.
Let me just...
But I've gotten to know him over the last three or four days. He has a wonderful temperament. He's just fine. Don't worry about it.
"The Middle East is totally destabilized - a total and complete mess. I wish we had the $4 trillion or $5 trillion. I wish it were spent right here in the United States on our schools, hospitals, roads, airports and everything else that are all falling apart."
"I really am. I'll be honest. I really am. I mean, people have been putting me..."
I really am.
Until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
I don't think he's qualified to be president.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Why not?
Because I don't think he has the right temperament. I don't think he's got the right judgment.
There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
The most crowd-pleasing line of the debate for this group - when Trump said Clinton would be in jail if he were president.
Because you'd be in jail.
"Everyone here downplayed the impact of high-profile GOP desertions in recent days. They say Trump still has a month to make his case to the American people. Last night, though, Michelle Teague did offer one bit of caution. She said Trump won the debate, but what if he lets loose again on Twitter?"
"I'm Donald Trump, and I approve this message."
"I will say this about Hillary. She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She's a fighter. I disagree with much of what she's fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit."
"I moved on her, and I failed. I'll admit it."
I did try and [expletive] her. She was married.
"You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. I just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything."
"Anyone who knows me, knows these words don't reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong, and I apologize."
We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.
"This was set up a little while ago. They were going to cancel it. And I said, why are you going to cancel it? Well, you wanted debate prep. I said, forget debate prep."
...That makes me smart.
"As a businessperson, I've legally used the tax laws to benefit - really I mean it's to my benefit - and the benefit of my company, my investors, my employees, my family."
I was able to use the tax laws of our country and my skills as a businessperson to dig out of this real estate depression when few others were able to do that.
"As a businessman and real estate developer, I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit and to the benefit of my company, my investors and my employees. I mean honestly, I brilliantly used those laws."
You just like me because my daughter happens to be Jewish.
Right?
"The only bad news, I can't get her on Saturday. I call and call. I can't."
"I really believe the Iran deal. Look, I'm a negotiator like you folks. We're negotiators."
Is there anybody that doesn't renegotiate deals in this room? This room negotiates that. I want to renegotiate - this room...
...Perhaps more than any room I've ever spoken to.
Because I don't want your money. Isn't it crazy?
"No, it's true. You know, if I wanted your money, I think I'd have a damn good chance, and I think I'd get more money than anybody else."
I'm leaving for Israel in a very short period of time. I know. I know what you're saying. I just want to...
"Who's the wise guy? Do me a favor. Just relax, OK. You'll like me very much, believe me, OK."
We are going to build a great border wall.
"On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth."
"I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list - and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists."
"You know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was - it was a real problem. We had a - we had a real problem. Not only that - her attitude. And we had a real problem with her."
"So she's got experience. That I agree. But it's a bad, bad experience."
Whether it's the Iran...
You want to know the truth? I was going to say something extremely...
"...Rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself..."
Wrong.
Wrong.
Wrong.
He hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I've never heard of this one. Look at those hands. Are they small hands?
"And he referred to my hands. If they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee."
"And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan. And everybody in the world watched, and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you. That was a very insulting statement that Ted made."
"This is your treasure. And you, the American people, are entitled to share in the riches."
"All I can say is you're lucky in Ohio that you struck oil. That's for one thing. Let me just tell you. I don't have to hear from this man, believe me."
"First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK? He hit oil. He got lucky with fracking. Believe me; that's why Ohio is doing well. Number - and that's important for you to know. Number two, this is the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes. And just thirdly, he was so nice. He was such a nice guy. And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack. But then his poll numbers tanked. He's got - that's why he's on the end. And he got nasty."
And he got nasty.
I would say I see a person that's 35 years old.
"Well, it's a lot of work, you know? When I'm speaking in front of 15,000 to 20,000 people and I'm up there using a lot of motion, I guess in its own way, it's a pretty healthy act."
"Over a period of years, I've given over a hundred million dollars to charity."
"Now this is a crowd. There are thousands of people outside that can't get in - fantastic. Way to go. Thank you. Thank you, everybody."
Polls came out today. We're up in Ohio. We're up in Florida. We're up in North Carolina - up. We're up nationwide. CNN two days ago - up nationwide.
"And with thousands of people outside, I challenge those cameras to show this arena packed. They never do."
"They never do. They never, ever do."
All the people who've rigged this system - and we have had a rigged system - for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop.
"It's been happening long enough. And the reason they don't do anything about it is because the special interests and the donors control our politicians, and they control Hillary Clinton."
Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign - and you know this - I mean the greatest series that I've ever seen of foreign policy failures and mistakes and blunders that anyone has ever seen. Everything she touches has turned bad. Now she wants to be president.
"I mean the only thing she's done well and she'll go down in history for, I have to admit, is getting out of trouble with the emails. That's the single greatest achievement of Hillary Clinton."
True.
"We're going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first, and we're going to keep our jobs in our country."
"We will also have a very, very strong border..."
"...That stops people and drugs - and those drugs are poisoning our youth and poisoning our people - from illegally pouring into our country. And we will build the wall, and Mexico will pay for the wall."
President Barack Obama was born in the United States - period.
"Well, I have really no problem in doing it. I have it right here. I mean, I - should I do it? I don't care."
"If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status."
"Under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble."
"I would really want to think about that one, Bill..."
BILL O'REILLY: All right.
"...Because in some ways, I think it's good, and in other ways, it's bad. I do want to see what the medical effects are."
"We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall. That'll be for a later date. This was a very preliminary meeting. I think it was an excellent meeting. And we are - I think we're very well on our way. A lot of the things I said are very strong, but we have to be strong. We have to say what's happening."
"I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice, just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?"
"For centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country - so true. It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation."
"We talk past each other, not to each other, and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on. They don't know. They have no clue. I'm here today to learn so that we can, together, remedy injustice in any form."
"As far as everybody else, we're going to go through the process. What people don't know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country - Bush, the same thing. Lots of people were brought out of the country with the existing laws."

There is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and come back.
"Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future. She's going to do nothing for African-Americans. She's going to do nothing for the Hispanics."
"You're racist. You're racist. You're racist. They keep saying it - you're racist. It's a tired, disgusting argument."
We have no choice if we're going to run our country properly and if we're going to be a country.
"Republican rivals mocked Trump's call for mass deportation as unrealistic and politically misguided, but many GOP primary voters embraced the idea as Trump boasted on MSNBC the following day."
"So many people are in love with it. The loudest applause last night at the debate was when I said this. Even I was surprised, but I mean the place went wild."
"Really great, great people come up to me, and they've said, Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person that's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and the family out - it's so tough, Mr. - I mean I have it all the time."
They have to pay taxes. There's no amnesty as such. There's no amnesty.

Totally false.

"I promise if I wanted it, I would've gotten it."

And what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring jobs back to this country, so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers you're talking about are going to be literally - they're going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country."
"I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new and really good-paying jobs. The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability as a nation to compete."
"Well, I disagree."
I mean with his bad policies - that's why ISIS came about.
"If he would have done things properly, you wouldn't have had ISIS."
Therefore he was the founder of ISIS.
Our government has unleashed ISIS. I call President Obama and Hillary Clinton the founders of ISIS. They're the founders.
"And if at the end of 90 days, I fall in short because I'm somewhat politically correct, even though I'm supposed to be the smart one and even though I'm supposed to have a lot of good ideas, it's OK. You know, I go back to a very good way of life."
"If I don't go all the way and if I don't win, I will consider it to be a total and complete waste of time, energy and money."

"Yes, OK, right."
"And I think the Quds, by the way, have been horribly mistreated by us."

"Four-hundred million dollars gets flown at night into Iran. I think it's so sad and so disgusting. And you also wonder about a government - who could approve a thing like that, where they take cash into a country and just hand it to them?"
"I woke up yesterday, and I saw $400 million - different currencies - they probably don't want our currency - different currencies - $400 million being flown to Iran. I mean, folks, what's going on here? What's going on? What is going on? You see it. You don't believe it - 400 million in cash."

"But when you think of it, what - and then they wanted me to denounce Putin. Why would I denounce him? For what?"
We're always fighting. We're the one that wants to go to World War III with Russia over Ukraine. So we're the ones always fighting. We're the ones putting up a lot of the money for NATO disproportionately - a lot.
Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police and the terrorism of our cities threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.
I want to thank the people of Cleveland and the people of Ohio.
"This was probably one of the most peaceful, one of the most beautiful, one of the most love-filled conventions in the history of conventions. And when they talk about unity, I want to tell you that was unity. That was unity, right?"

He'll come and endorse - just cause he has no choice. But I don't want his endorsement. What difference does it make? I don't want his endorsement."

So I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign and the White House to fix our rigged system.

Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you.
"This is war. If you look at it, this is war coming from all different parts. And frankly, it's war. And we're dealing without - with people without uniforms."

"So you have the star, which is fine. I said, we shouldn't have taken it down. You know, they took the star down. I said, too bad; you should've left it up. I would have rather defended it - just leave it up and say, no, that's not a Star of David. That's just a star. It tells you about corrupt Hillary - corrupt Hillary."

People are coming into our country. We have no idea - and they're from all over the world. We have no idea who they are.
"I really do see a parallel between what's happening in the United States and what what's happening here. People want to see borders. They don't necessarily want people pouring into their country that they don't know who they are and where they come from. They have no idea. And I think, you know, it - not only did it win, but it won by a much bigger margin than people thought it would happen."
"And if the bullets were going in the other direction, aimed this guy who was just open target practice -"
The Muslims have to work with us. They have to work with us. They know what's going on. They know that he was bad. They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad. But you know what? They didn't turn them in.

"We're only getting started, and it's going to be beautiful. Remember that."
You've given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall.
"We're going to do it. We're going to do it, folks. We're going to do it. I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle, and I will never, ever let you down - too much work, too many people, blood, sweat and tears - never going to let you down."
He's Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico.
"Crooked Hillary said, oh, Donald Trump, his finger on the button. I'm the one that didn't want to go into Iraq, folks. And she's the one that stupidly raised her hand to go into Iraq and destabilize the entire Middle East - OK? - 'cause that's what she did."
"And it's not the computer stuff or the Internet stuff. You know, you open it - and you open a love site, and it's worth $700 million. It's day one, and these kids never saw anything like it."
"You know, they come up to meet me - a lot of the guys from Silicon - and they're wearing undershirts. I could tell you a story. Some of the biggest in the world - they'll come in on rollerskates."
"The RNC's been doing it for many years. Reince has really upped it and all over the country they have very good people, and part of the benefit is we get to use those people."

"She talked about guns in classrooms. I don't want to have guns in classrooms. Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly.

But remember, in some cases - and a lot of people have made this case - teachers should be able to have guns."

"Well, I think the only card she has is the woman's card. She's got nothing else going. And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote."

"To our friends and allies, I say, America is going to be strong again. America is going to be reliable again."
"The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense. And if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves."
We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. There's nothing.
"Because it's a rigged system, because it's a corrupt enterprise, in politics, you're allowed to collude. So they colluded, and actually I was happy because it shows how weak they are. It shows how pathetic they are."

"If we're 20 votes short or if we're, you know, 100 short and we're at 1,100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400 - 'cause we're way ahead of everybody - I don't think you can say that we don't get it automatically. I think it would be - I think you'd have riots. I think you'd have riots."
The word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration. We have to. We have to.
"They really stopped these people in terms of our First Amendment freedom of speech - a terrible situation, I have to tell you."

"Now, I heard, and I saw just a little bit of it. But I heard that Mitt Romney made a fairly long speech."
"You can see how loyal he is. He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees. He would've dropped to his knees."
(CHEERING
He was begging.
Mitt is a failed candidate. He failed.
"OK, so let me tell you. I'm sitting in a house in Florida with a very bad earpiece that they gave me, and you can hardly hear what he was saying.

I see him starting to sweat. Thank God he has really large ears - the biggest ears I've ever seen - because they were protecting him. It was going - I have never seen any human being sweat like this guy.
"He took 50 bullets and he dipped them in pig's blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people. And they shot 49 of those people, and the 50th person - he said you go back to your people and you tell them what happened."

Respect whatever it is that you have to respect because it was a point in time and put it in a museum.
You see these guys making these enormous amounts of money. It's a total and complete joke.
I love Iowa. We've done really well here.

"I have been opposed to Obamacare from the day they conceived it, and Ted Cruz comes out with an ad that I'm in favor of Obamacare - can you believe this? - just like he did with Carson, where Carson, he said, left Iowa.

We're going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with great, great powerful, wonderful health care."
"We're going to win again. I'll tell you what. We're going to win again. We're going to win at every single level. And we're not going to be laughed at throughout the rest of the world because believe me, they laugh at our stupidity. They cannot believe what's happening. We send weapons over to our allies. A gun is fired in the air. They hear one sound of a bullet. They drop the weapons. The enemy takes them, and now people come back from the Middle East, and they tell me, Mr. Trump, they have better weapons than we do. They have the new versions. They have the best weapons - the enemy - not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen anymore. I will tell you."

"Iowa, will you get your numbers up, please?"
Will you get these numbers up?
"She was going beat - she was favored to win, and she got schlonged. She lost. I mean, she lost."
I will demand an apology from Hillary. She should apologize. She lies about emails. She lies about Whitewater. She lies about everything. She will be a disaster as president of the United States.
Our country is out of control. People are pouring across the Southern border. I will build a wall. It'll be a great wall. People will not come in unless they...

"The thing that I'm most happy about, in the history of radio, I'm told, this is the largest opening of a show. And so that's pretty impressive."
"When you made your presentation, you choked. Do you agree with ha?"
"Well, I think it was a natural fit. She`s a friend of mine and she`s a very brave woman and when the head of ""Time"" magazine asked me to do it, I was very happy about that. So I hope they like it."
I want shutters on the outside.
"Now, Craig, the executives felt that you weren`t deep enough, at least with them. They felt your answers lacked substance and the one thing they all had in common Craig, was that you should be the one to go and therefore, I have to say, Craig, you`re fired."
You're fired. You're fired. You're fired.
You're fired. You're fired. You're fired. I realized right after I said it how beautiful those words are.
You're fired. You're fired. You're fired.
He would never endorse a product that he didn't believe in. Why did you put your name on that building? Because it's going to be the best.
It was fairly rough because you have a lot of people that don't really know both sides of any given story and they're writing about it.
It's been that way since I was born. He's always had it -- he's always had it that way. It works for him. He's almost afraid to do anything with it now because it's like Sampson. Who knows what happens if I cut it and everything changes.
"Rebecca, you're outstanding. Randal, you're hired."
"I'm Donald Trump and I'm always on the lookout for talented people. I'm looking for someone who's a natural leader. I'm looking for someone who is a strategic thinker. I'm looking for ""The Apprentice."""
Nice to see you
"Rosie O'Donnell is disgusting, I mean, both inside and out. You take a look at her. She's a slob. She talks like a truck driver. She doesn't have her facts. She'll say anything that comes to her mind. And, you know, her show failed when it was a talk show. She failed on that. The ratings went very, very low and very bad. And she got essentially thrown off television. Her magazine was a total catastrophe. She got sued. And I mean, she's basically a disaster. She called me a snake oil salesman. Coming from Rosie, that's pretty low, because when you look at her, and when you see the mind, the mind is weak. I don't see it. I don't get it. I never understood, how does she even get on television. I'll probably sue Rosie because she doesn't tell the facts. As an example, I'm worth many billions of dollars. It's not to brag about. I'm worth many billions of dollars, it's very simple. She said I was bankrupt. Now, I never went bankrupt. She said I filed bankruptcy three times. I never filed bankruptcy. I never went bankrupt, but she said I went bankrupt. So probably I'll sue her, because it would be fun. I'd like to take some money out of her fat ass pockets."

"When that was a much different thing, Larry. I mean, Tara was having a problem and we're taking care of the problem. And I think it is going to work out great. But Miss Nevada was a disaster. The pictures were disgusting. They brought them up to my office today. I viewed them. And, you know, I've seen pictures before. You fully understand that, Larry, but these pictures were pretty far out there. And that is not representative of Miss USA. And it's not representative of Miss Nevada. We had no choice but to terminate her."
"Thank you, Larry."
"It`s absolutely unbelievable to me. I thought I was doing the town a favor with a gift to the town from me. The size of the flag is absolutely perfect. It`s a similar size to that flying over the White House in Washington. And yet, Mar-A-Lago is actually larger than the White House. The community totally loves the American flag flying just where it is. And the town council wants me to rip down the American flag and just -- it`s disgraceful, Nancy, and hard to believe."
"I wouldn`t get it, so that was very important. You know, a lot of people would say, ""Why didn`t you apply for permits?"" I would have applied, but they told me that, if I applied, I won`t get it. And, number two, it`s my contention and my attorney`s contention that you don`t need permits to put up the American flag."
I would probably be inclined not to like on the basis that he lost an election that should have been won.
You know how they get out? They get out. That's how they get out. Declare victory and leave.
President Bush is probably the worst president in the history of the United States.
"Well, I wasn't surprised, I've been predicting this for a long time. Rosie is a very self-destructive person, Rosie's basically a loser. I believe ABC wanted her out, and they wanted her out badly and fast. She made statements the other day at the Waldorf Historia that were absolutely outrageous, the way she grabbed her crotch and said things that were just terrible. I mean, she's a slob, everybody knows it, and they wanted her out, and the one that wanted her our the most was Barbara Walters."
"I just love the way he dresses. I wouldn't do it, but man, do those suspenders look good on television."
"""The Apprentice"" hit the right nerve at the right time. You're fired. You're fired. You're fired."
"I just love the way he dresses. I wouldn't do it, but man, do those suspenders look good on television."
"""The Apprentice"" hit the right nerve at the right time. You're fired. You're fired. You're fired."
I am.
"No, but I'm surprised hearing Robert. Because Robert is a great friend of mine. We have a best-selling book out, and I can't -- I never thought of him as a gambler. And I think when you go out and buy stock, especially in this world -- now, I think a little bit later down the line he would have been better off. But we're going to see what happens. I think it's going to get very ugly unless interest rates go down."
"Barbara Walters, if you ask her, and if she tells you what she`s really thinking, she is not thrilled with Rosie. Believe me."
"I think President Bush has to go into a corner and hide if Republicans are going to get elected. There is no way he's an asset, he's a huge liability."
"No, I love women. Women love me."
It's a pigsty and I say get your house clean.
"I'm not saying she's not an attractive woman, but she's not a great beauty by any stretch of the imagination."
Do this interview with somebody else. You don`t need this. Do it with somebody else.
"Well, it's unbelievable anger, Larry. I heard people saying things that you wouldn't even believe. A very major senator saying that the people that did this should commit suicide. That's a pretty strong statement, I would say. It is a -- it is very bad politics in terms of what AIG did. They took $165 billion in money from the government and now they're going around giving out bonuses and giving people bonuses that really, in many cases, did not do a very good job and, in many cases, took the bonus and left right after the bonus. And the bonuses were supposed to hold these people together and hold them into the company -- hold them in the company. So I think it's a very, very foolish thing that they did. And certainly should have used a different name if they had to do something."
"Well, we actually -- this is a first. But we actually went back and added up the scores and that was not that -- she would not have won anyway."
"Carrie will remain Miss California. It was a controversial question. It was a tough question. It was probably a fair question, because it's asked of many people. And I've often said it, if her beauty wasn't so great, nobody really would have cared."
"Well, Larry, as you know, I knew him very well. He was a great guy. He was actually a very, very smart business man. He was somebody that was very special. He lived in Trump Tower for an extended period of time in New York -- and right next to me, actually. And so I got to know him very well. He would go down to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach a lot. In fact, that's where he was with Lisa Marie Presley when it first came out. And he was there for a very long period of time. But he would go down often."
"Well, it's a very sad situation. It was a terrible, terrible decision that was made. The decision was incorrect. Jay Leno was doing very nicely. David Letterman is a great guy. They're all my friends of mine. I mean my problem is I'm friends with everybody..."
Barron's really great.

"Well, I've never heard of this poll, but I am anxious to find out what it says. I do not know anything about a poll taken in New Hampshire."
"Tom and Alex, they've been terrific partners. And Zenith (ph) is going to get married."
I think Bush is probably the worst president in the history of the United States. I always said the worst president was Jimmy Carter. Guess what? Jimmy carter goes to second place. Barack Obama has been the worst president ever.
"By the way, Ron Paul cannot get elected, I'm sorry to tell you."
"I thought it was a disgrace. That security guard on the right was pathetic. He wouldn't work for me for 15 seconds. That guy, they should have pummeled him, pummeled him to the ground."
"Oh, isn't that cute?"
Maybe Dennis is a lot better than what we have.
"Just keep going, Barbara. She looks great. She`s got tremendous stamina. She`s a great woman and she`s going to keep going."
"I have found this very difficult. The good news, it`s between the two of you. I have no question in my mind that I think you are both outstanding. I didn`t like ""The Amazing,"" and you were the director, you should have put the product in. Stephen, you`re fired."
"We have to be very, very careful. The Republicans cannot have a death wish. The Republicans can win the next election. The next election is going to be tough. I really believe it's going to be Hillary. But Hillary can be beaten, and the Democrats can be beaten."
"At Trump University, we teach success. That's what it's all about, success."
"Well, I hear it is a terrible, terrible movie. Sony has no courage or guts."
You're fired.
"They're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists and some I assume are good people."
Somebody has to come out and tell it like it is.
"So, you have the illegals come in and the illegals killed their children."
"I don't need anybody's money. I'm using my own money, I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors, I don't area. I'm really rich."
"I don't need anybody's money. I'm using my own money, I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors, I don't area. I'm really rich."
He's not a war hero.
"I'm using my own money, I'm not using the lobbyist, I'm not using donors, I don't care. I'm really rich."
"I cannot say, I have to respect the person that if it's not me the person that wins. If I do win, and I'm leading by quite a bit, that's what I want to do. I can totally make that pledge if I'm the nominee I will pledge I would not run as an Independent."
Only Rosie O'Donnell.
All I was doing was referring to her anger. I said nothing wrong whatsoever.
Honestly? I think we are led by stupid people.
"We have to make a whole new set of standards. And when people come in, they have to come in legally."
They have to go.
"I'm Donald Trump. I wrote ""The Art of the Deal"". I say not in a braggadocious way, I've made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world, and I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again. We build our military, we take care of our vets, we get rid of Obamacare, and we have a great life altogether. Thank you. Thank you."
"They will say tomorrow Mr. Trump drew a nice crowd of six or 700 people. Yes, like it got to be - how many people do we have here? 20, 18? Something. But they will say we had 1,000 people. I mean they really do distort and they are terrible people, not all of them, but many of them and I have to say this, I have to say this, it's sort of doesn't matter because the one thing I found, look at that. Look where this crowd goes to. Cameras, can you do us a favor and instead of just, you know, they are just panning on me and they won't say -- do me a favor. Take the cameras off me and pan the crowd. Okay?"
"Well, I think we have a president that just doesn't know what he is doing. Either you do it, or you don't it. 50 people. He puts 50 people."
"The biggest crowds by far so much bigger than Bernie Sanders you know you always have Bernie Sanders our crowds - may he rest in peace - you know he had an operation today. I think it was a hernia operation. You know, you know why? Carrying along too much tax problems because he is going to tax you, let us not even talk -- tax problems, he wants to double and triple everyone's -- wants to bring you up to ninety percent."
"We head back last year and I saw a loving that Rome, I see love everywhere I go."
"Thank you. I began this journey six months ago. My total focus was on building up our military, building up our strength, building up our borders, making sure that China, Japan, Mexico, both at the border and in trade, no longer takes advantage of our country. Certainly would never have made that horrible, disgusting, absolutely incompetent deal with Iran where they get $150 billion. They're a terrorist nation. But I began it talking about other things. And those things are things that I'm very good at and maybe that's why I'm center stage. People saw it. People liked it. People respected it. A month ago things changed. Radical Islamic terrorism came into effect even more so than it has been in the past. People like what I say. People respect what I say. And we've opened up a very big discussion that needed to be opened up. Thank you very much."
"I think so. I think we're doing great, and I just had a poll today where I'm leading in Iowa. And I think we're going to do a great in Iowa. I have amazing relationship to the people in Iowa, and to the evangelicals, and everybody. We're doing really well. We're doing well all over. We have a big poll just came out nationwide where I'm leading by 27 points, the Monmouth Poll, very respected. And so I think we're doing well. We're getting the message across. We're not being politically correct because we don't have time to be politically correct. We have to do what's right."
And I'm at number one by a lot.
"When Mexico sends its people, they are not sending their best."
"With me, they're dealing with somebody that's a little bit different. They can't toy with me like they toy with everybody else. So let them have their debate and let's see how they do with the ratings."
"We're not seeing a lot of courage here, are we?"
"I've heard for years he kept the country safe after -- what does that mean after? What about during 9/11? I was there. I lost a lot of friends that were killed in that building. The worst attack ever in this country, it was during his presidency. I mean, we had the worst attack ever. By the way, after that we did okay. That's meaning, the team scored 19 runs in the first inning, but after that we played well. I don't think so."
"We have to be very careful. We have to be very vigilant. But to think that Apple won't allow us to get into her cell phone. Who do they think they are? No, we have to open it up."
I will be totally prepared. People have not done well against me.
So far everybody that's attacked me has gone down.
"Tax returns are very complicated. I have many, many companies. I have tremendously -- I have a very complex system of taxes. But we'll make a determination over the next couple of months."
"The most important thing is you have to have somebody that can be a great president. But after that, you want somebody that can help you with legislation, getting it through, et cetera, et cetera. We're going to probably choose somebody that's somewhat political."
This was an endorsement that really meant a lot.
Other than that I rest my case.
That is so wrong. Rubio has decided the only way to take down the GOP front-runner is to match insult with insult.
He was sweating so badly --
"I will not say that he was trying to cover up his ears. I need water. Help me. I need water. Help. When you're a choke artist, you're always a choke artist."
Nice part about the -- you have many different plans. You'll have competition. You'll have so many different plans.
"No, I'm not repeating -- no, no, no."
He's the guy who repeats himself. You repeat yourself every day.
Talking about repeating. I watched him repeat himself five times four week ago.
When you walk onto a stage you cannot walk like a penguin. He walked like a penguin.
"Honestly it was terrible. I was with him. They had the flood, they had the hurricane and Obama went to New Jersey and he was like -- he was like a little child. He was like a little boy. Oh, I'm with the president. Remember he flew in the helicopter and he was all excited to be in the helicopter? I said I would have put you in my helicopter, it's much nicer. Still. No, I thought it was a terrible thing."
"I think, though, they've been saying the silent majority. He speaks for all of us and has given us a voice."
It's nice to have somebody that's not a canned politician. He's not in the box. He thinks outside of the box.
He has tapped into -- -- the anger in America. I think that he is a person that's going to go down as one of the greatest presidents in history.
"I mean, he's very charismatic. Nobody is wittier or smarter or quicker on the draw than he is. That's for sure. But, also, there was like, the boldness about him and an independence that appealed to me."
You tell me about this guy.
I have a lot of friends that's cringe when he says things. But it's Trump. That's who he is. That's what he does.
People who want to come into this country need to pay their dues and need to work as hard as everybody else to stay here.
"And if you listen to Trump, he actually does present plans and what his policies are on every issue. You know, I don't hear that coming from these other candidates."
I do. I do. I think Ted has revealed himself to be someone who is not someone that we would trust.
Nobody has gone to Washington that we have elected and did what they said they were going to do.
I'm the only one of the states that's hired people. You haven't hired anything.
"Trump, 49 percent; little lightweight Marco Rubio, 16 percent; lying Ted Cruz, 15 percent."
Are you from Mexico?
"No, I don't think so."
I won Louisiana. I won it easily.
-- and because of the shenanigans that goes on and --
I know the rules very well. But I know that it's stacked against me by the establishment.
And they changed the rules a number of months ago. The people --
"Well, that's not very long ago."
-- they saw how I was doing and they didn't like it.
"They are always saying be nicer on the debates. I said, wait a minute, they are coming at me from all these different angles. Well, how can I be nice? But Melania in particular would say be nicer in the debates. I said I can't do that. I have to win first."
"Everyone talks about that, a tone but there also comes a time where you actually have to put the hammer down, right. There comes a time where being nice and trying to do all this stuff, when people are laughing at your face, you have to actually fight back. And that's what's so important about what he does."
"It's easy to do it. I mean, it's easier to do it than the way I behave right now."
Because I have two more people I have to take out.
"During the evenings after 7 o'clock or so, I will always do it by myself."
"He's just always had so much love for us and this whole family. He's an amazing guy, one of my best friends in the entire world, maybe my best friend in the entire world."
"No, I don't think so --"
"He also taught me that there wasn't anything that I couldn't do. I don't think that's a message a father would relay to a daughter who didn't believe had the potential to accomplish, exactly what her brothers could."
My father since I have been a little girl has inspired me and had so much faith in me to be the best person I can be and the best woman I can be.
"Everyone talks about that at tone, but there also comes a time where you actually have to put the hammer down, right. There comes a time where, you know, being nice and trying to do all of this stuff when people are laughing at your face, you have to actually fight back. That's what is so important about what he does."
To use nice language.
It's easier to do it. It's easier to do it than the way I behave right now.
Because I have two more people I have to take out.
"During the evenings after 7:00 or so, I will always do it by myself."
We had a great night last night in New York.
I'm about 300 delegates ahead of lyin' Ted.
"Crooked Hillary, she said, very strongly, I don't like the tone of Donald Trump.' The tone. Now she's there shouting all night long, reading off teleprompters. Does she ever make a speech where there's not -- I mean, she won the other night. I'm sorta glad she won, you know, I really want to beat her more than Sanders."
Has anybody ever heard of Ivanka? Huh? People love Ivanka.
"With him, what you see is what you get even if you don't like his viewpoint on a certain topic."
"You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever."
"Ivanka is very much like him in many ways, in sort of the meticulous nature of things."
Wow.
And we have a person running for office who is not equipped to be President. She doesn't have the temperament to be President. She's got bad judgment.
"It's possible, yes. Yes, that would be possible."
"He's proud of his heritage, OK. I'm building a wall. He's a Mexican."
"Jake, I'm building a wall, OK. I'm building a wall."
"I think it will be a good thing. You are taking your country back. You are going to let people that you want into your country and people that you don not want or people that you do not think are going to be appropriate for your country or good for your country, you are not going to have to take."
"It's interesting to me that people keep saying he was lucky. He was not lucky at all. I heard him talking about this for days, and when people were telling him when do you want to schedule your trip to Scotland? It is like this is it. And he was the one that predicted it. Now, he is not some kind of soothsayer, he is just somebody who is tapped into the vein of the populist movement. I think while there is going to be two different people on the ballot in November here, it is also two different ideas. It is Americanism versus Globalism. It is very similar to the question that was on the ballot yesterday in Britain, and I think you might see a very similar result."
"I am going to have very few troops on the ground. We're going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need, which right now we don't have. We don't have the people over there."
He will be the best president ever.
I'll bet she gives a great speech. She's worked hard on it. I will be there. I want to watch. It's going to be very exciting.
"Melania, say something. Please."
"He is battle tested. He is a dreamer but perhaps more importantly, he is a doer."
She's a secret weapon.
"My wife called just before. She said, darling, would you please react presidentially? Be presidential."
"Oh, she's going to be a great first lady. I want to just tell you one thing. One thing I will tell you. She is beautiful, but she's more beautiful even on the inside. She's a great person and, boy, is she smart."
"I thought it was terrific the way she came forward and just said, look, it was a mistake that I made. And she thought it was very unfair to Melania."
That was a war that we shouldn't -- because Iraq did not knock down --
I don't care.
"We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president. I promised you that."
"Don't even think about it. It will be built and it will go up fast and it'll be big and it'll be high and strong. We must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will seize to have a country. Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, right? He was a bad guy, really bad guy. But, you know what he did well? He killed terrorists."
"But once in a while he'll say things, and I'll tell him he could probably do with ratcheting it back."
"Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. More than party affiliation, I vote based on what I believe is right for my family and for my country."
I will do everything within my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me.
"My dad is a natural born encourager, the last person who will ever tell you to lower your sights or give up your dream."
"For my father, impossible is just the starting point. That's how he approaches business projects. That's how he approaches life."
"Dad, you have once again taught us by example. You are my hero. You are my best friend. You are the next president of the United States."
ISIS has spread. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Refugee crisis threatens the West.
"When my father says he will make America great again, he will deliver."
USA! USA! Attacks on our police and terrorism on our cities threaten our very way of life.
"On January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored."
I will do everything within my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me.
The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.
ISIS has spread. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. A refugee crisis threatens the West.
"When my father says that he will make America great again, he will deliver."
"USA, USA. Attacks on our police, terrorism in our cities threaten our very way of life."
"On January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored."
"I saw him. He was, you know, very emotional and probably looked like a nice guy to me. His wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there, she had nothing to say. She probably -- maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say, you tell me."
I humbly --
"If you want someone to fight for you and your country, I can assure you, he`s the guy."
And this is the moment and Donald Trump is the person to make America great again.
I am your voice!
I will restore law and order to our country.
My message is that things have to change and they have to change right now!
For the presidency of the United States.
I love you. And we will make America great again.
No one's going to outwork him. No one's got more energy than him.
"He always said to us, find what it is that you're passionate about and pursue it with your full heart."
"They're illegal immigrants, they came over illegally, some wonderful people and they've been here for a while, they've got to go out."
"I look at the television. I think it's a disgusting thing, and it's being pushed. They have no witnesses. There's nobody around. They just come out. Some are doing it for probably a little fame. Phony accusers come out less than a month before one of the most important elections in the history of our country."
Hello. How are you? Hi.
"The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing false allegations and outright lies. The process is rigged. This whole election is being rigged. And remember this, it's a rigged election because you have phony people coming up with phony allegations."
This whole election is being rigged.
"Come on, Billy, let's go."
That's better.
"They made up stories. You know why? Fame, or they wanted to help Clinton, or something. They made up stories."
"George, let's not waste anymore time. These stories were fabricated. They are total lies."
The polls have been amazing.
Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough.
I have a winning temperament. Hillary is an unstable person.
We know Hillary can't be trusted. We've learned that.
"And you take a look at her email situation, can we trust her with our security? She is disqualified."
"To think of her being their boss? I don't think so. And you know, they're incredible patriots. But I know what they're thinking. It's not -- it's not for them, believe me."
"They're so much more brave than me. I wouldn't have done what they did. I'm brave in other ways. I'm brave -- I'm financially brave. Big deal, right?"
She got up and gave an incredible speech.
She's a slob. I call her goofy. She's a basket case.
"Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers. We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other. We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media."
"If I said exactly what you said, I'd get killed for it. But I think I'll say it anyway. The guy does deserve a bullet. I mean, these aren't good people. These are horrible people."

"Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough especially to children and teenagers. It is never okay when a 12- year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied or attacked. It is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the Internet."
She's a slob. I call her goofy. She's a basket case.
And they are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America.
"Two years ago when we promised the city of D.C. that Trump would be coming to Pennsylvania Avenue in 2016, we had no idea what we were foreshadowing."
"I want to back my children. My children work very hard, Ivanka in particular. And at the opening of the hotel, I want to back my children."
"Jared's a very smart guy, a very good guy -- the people who know him. He's a quality person. And I think he could be very helpful. I would love to be able be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians."
"So, I just want to thank you (INAUDIBLE.) Would you like to say a couple of words?"
"So, I want to thank everybody. We've had such great, great support in this room. And we have -- I think, Mitch is here. Where is Mitch McConnell? There he is. Sitting next to the ambassador. Sitting next to the ambassador, Wade Johnson. (INAUDIBLE.) Congratulations. Thank you. John Cornyn is here, Senator. Where is John? Thank you, John. John was"
You're fired. You're fired. You're fired.
"We will be stronger and bigger and better as a nation than ever before. We're right on track. We're going to come out and join you and enjoy your company for a roll, a great Easter egg roll, and I don't know if we're going to be successful, but I know a lot of people down there are going to be successful. I've seen those kids, and they are highly, highly competitive. That I can tell you. I just want to thank First Lady Melania Trump. She's really worked hard on this."
"Ready, set --"
"And where are you from? Go ahead. Come here, come here. Where are you from? Should we have all of this beautiful Irish press. Where are you from?"
"Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough. We have to find better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other."
"I'll tell you, I think I have the best temperament or certainly one of the best temperaments of anybody that's ever run for the office of president, ever."
This is everything. This is everything.
I think it's a meeting that most people in politics probably would have taken.
This is everything. This is everything.
"Obama, it was reported today, played 250 rounds of golf. Everything's executive order because he doesn't have enough time because he's playing so much golf. Obama ought to get off the golf course and get down there. I'm going to be working for you. I'm not going to have time to go play golf. He played more golf last year than Tiger Woods. This guy plays more golf than people on the PGA Tour. I love golf, I think it's one of the greats but I don't have time. If I were in the White House, I don't think I'd ever seen Turnberry again. I don't think I would ever see Doral again. I'm not going to be playing much golf, believe me. If I win this, I'm not going to be playing much golf."
Absolutely. They should be thinking about it. And frankly --
"I have the direct number to the White House but I don't really going to call him there because Melania is there and I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that because I'm basically first Trump wife, her first lady you could say."
"It's wrong, isn't it?"
Then it's a deal?
Crust first.
"Actually, you're only entitled to half."
"It's wrong, isn't it."
"Of course, I'm right. I'm always right. I'm Donald Trump. I'm always right. And Donald Trump is telling you right now, Slim Shady is a winner. He's got brains, he's got guts, and he's got Donald Trump's vote."
"I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election. As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership, I believe in our intel agencies, our intelligence agencies, I've worked with them very strongly."
"Hilary Clinton had the reset button. She wanted to get back together with Russia. She even spelled reset wrong, that's how it started and then it got worse. President Obama wanted to get along with Russia, but the chemistry wasn't there. Getting along with other nations is a good thing, not a bad thing, believe me. It's a good thing, not a bad thing."
Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. Total fabrication. The events never happened. Never.

"It's the largest tax cut in the history of our country, and reform but tax cut."
Melania and I are delighted to wish America and the entire world a very merry Christmas.
"At this time of year, we see the best of America and the soul of the American people."
"We had a massive field of people. You saw that. I looked out. The field was -- it looked like a million, a million and a half people."
"One, two, three."
We have reduced unnecessary regulations to a point that this country hasn't seen in years.
You will go down as one of the truly great justices in the history of the United States Supreme Court.
It is an extraordinary resume.
"If it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea."
Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself.
"People are going to be very, very happy. They're going to get tremendous, tremendous tax cuts."
Let's see what happens.
"We are going to have a tremendous year: the stock market I think is going to continue to go up, companies are going to continue to come in to the country, and they're doing it now soon to be a record clip."
"This should be a bipartisan bill. This should be a bill of love. Truly, it should be a bill of love."
"Well, let me say, who gets fired? It always has to be the top. I mean problems start from the top and they have to get solved from the top. And the president's the leader."
This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.

"In all fairness, who hasn't said something or done something that they regret simply trying to protect somebody that they care about? And I care about Mr. Trump."
"And then you mentioned other names and there's no contest. You know, I mean, there is no contest."
I don't think mitt needs lots of money but he'll do what is necessary. We need somebody great as a president. I think he'll be a great president.
"I think this year the Coast Guard maybe in terms of increase branding. The brand of the Coast Guard has been something incredible, what's happened. Saved 16,000 people, many of them in Texas for what ever reason that is. People went out in their boats to watch the hurricane, that didn't work out to well."
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Thank you Jeff, thank you very much. Administrator Scott Pruitt, thank you, Scott, very much. EPA is doing really, really well. And you know somebody has to say that about you, a little bit. You know that Scott. But you've done - I'll tell you the EPA is doing so well."
"Well, I think the minimum would be relationship. You'd start at least a dialogue, because a deal person I've done very well with deals. What you want to do is start that. Now, I'd like to accomplish more than that, but at a minimum I do believe at least we will have met each other, we will have seen each other, hopefully we will have liked each other and we'll start that process."
"Some people like the idea of bringing Russia back in, this used to be the G8, not the G7 and something happened a while ago where Russia is no longer in - - I think it would be an asset to have Russia back in. I think it would be good for the world, I think it would be good Russia, I think it would be good for the United States, I think it would be good for all of the countries of the current G7."
Where's Don? Get up here.
"He was on CNN on Sunday with Jake. Jake's tough. He's smart. He's fair. Yes, pretty fair. But Jake was grilling him and this guy was unbelievable. In fact, I was writing down some of the things he was saying."
Are you bored of winning?
"He's built a great business by realizing that he does not know everything, but he's brought in the best people. He listens to them. That's how you're successful."
But really it went nowhere and it was apparent that that wasn't what the meeting was actually about.
"I'd just like to have Jeff Sessions do his job, and if he did I'd be very happy. But the job entails two sides, not one side."
"It's a regime that frankly could be toppled very quickly by the military, if the military decides to do that. And you saw how the military spread as soon as they heard a bomb go off way above their head. That military was running for cover."
"You know, all my life I've had very few stories, but I've had some on the front page of the New York Times. Now I think I average about three or four a day, right? And up to three or four, they're all negative. No matter what I do, they're negative. But you know what? That's OK. I still love the paper. Go ahead."
"He should give information may be on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at. Because where does that money, that's the money in the family. And I guess he didn't want to talk about his father in law -- he's trying to get his sentence reduced. So, it's pretty sad. You know, it's weak."
I'm going to get the best people for the job. We're going to use our smartest and our best. We're going to get the best people in the world.
"She gets out and she starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions and you see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her where ever. A person who is flat-chested is very hard to be a ten. I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. When you're star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the"
"Now he has to use executive action. This is a very, very dangerous thing that should be overridden easily by the Supreme Court. We are looking at now a situation where it should absolutely not pass muster in terms of the constitutionality. But it depends on what these justices do."
We thought it wasn't a good thing to be signing anything.
I don't believe that he would have allowed that to happen. It wasn't to his advantage to allow that to happen. He felt very badly but he knew the case very well but knew it later. He tells me he didn't know about it and I take him at his word.
The president had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husband's clearance.
No. I don't think I have the authority to do that. I'm not sure I do.
I - I wouldn't -- I wouldn't do it.
"Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they'd be getting the electric chair by right now."
"Why was that our request, just out of curiosity?"
