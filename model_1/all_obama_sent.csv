"I think Nancy Pelosi, when the history is written, will go down as one of the most effective legislative leaders that we - this country has ever seen."
That is some kind of gall. That some kind of chutzpah. But let's also call what it is - it is a lie.
"If they keep control of Congress, you'd better they're coming after your health care."
"(Singing) Amazing grace, how sweet the sound..."
(Singing) ...That saved a wench like me.
"You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."
"It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause."
"But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now. We would be making the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons about America, to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality."
"The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through, a part of our union that we have not yet to perfect."
"And if we walk away now, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for every American."
"Most working and middle-class white Americans don't feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience. As far as they're concerned, no one handed them anything, they've built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pensions dumped after a lifetime of labor."
"They are anxious about their futures, and they feel their dreams slipping away, and in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town, when they hear an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed, when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudice, resentment builds over time."
"Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation."
"So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty, trafficking in bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage."
"The United States will contribute out unique capabilities at the front end of the mission to protect Libyan civilians and enable the enforcement of a no-fly zone that'll be led by our international partners. And as I said yesterday, we will not - I repeat: we will not - deploy any U.S. troops on the ground."
"We've made significant progress on deepening our cooperation in the areas of education, science, technology, climate change, public health, as well as security issues."
I convened our first summit six years ago in this same room because the danger of a terrorist group obtaining and using a nuclear weapon is one of the greatest threats to global security.
"There is no doubt that if these madmen ever got their hands on a nuclear bomb or nuclear material, they most certainly would use it to kill as many innocent people as possible."
"I want to congratulate the Gang of Six for coming up with a plan that I think is balanced. We just received it, so we haven't reviewed all the details of it. It would not match perfectly with some of the approaches that we've taken, but I think that we're in the same playing field."
"The United States has never been afraid to pursue diplomacy with our adversaries. And as president, I decided that a strong, confident America could advance our national security by engaging directly with the Iranian government."
"And it may be that some of their claims are legitimate. But they shouldn't just try to establish that based on throwing elbows and pushing people out of the way. If in fact their claims are legitimate, people will recognize it."
"You are an example of what is possible when, in the face of tragedy and in the face of hardship, good people come together to lend a hand. And brick by brick, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, you built a better future."
"An American city dark and underwater, and this was something that was supposed to never happen here - maybe someplace else, but not here, not in America."
The United States of America is changing its relationship with the people of Cuba.
"You know, I don't think you ever nail anything down right here. It's always moving."
"It is clear that the two of them had gone down the dark path of radicalization, embracing a perverted interpretation of Islam that calls for war against America and the West."
"These men and women were not hardened criminals, but the overwhelming majority had been sentenced to at least 20 years. Fourteen of them had been sentenced to life for nonviolent drug offenses. So their punishments didn't fit the crime."
"I believe that, at its heart, America is a nation of second chances. And I believe these folks deserve their second chance."
I'm ready to act in the face of this outrage. Today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move forward together as one nation.
The agreements and memoranda that we reached I think reflect the seriousness with which both of us take the climate change issue.
"India and the United States have a shared vision of peace, of democracy, of countries resolving conflicts diplomatically rather than through war."
I'm expecting a gold watch...
...From Boeing at the end of my presidency because I know that I'm on the list of top salesmen at Boeing.
There's no reason why we can't get that done. That is not a liberal idea or a conservative idea. It's not a Democratic or Republican idea. That is a smart idea. We want to keep those guns out of hands of folks who shouldn't have them.
"I'm going to speak plainly and honestly about what's happened here because the American people are trying to figure out, how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen?"
"And we pray that the violence in Egypt will end and that the rights and aspirations of the Egyptian people will be realized, and that a better day will dawn over Egypt and throughout the world."
"I'm hoping you think it's wrong to hear people spend years, months vilifying people, questioning their patriotism, calling them enemies of the people. And then suddenly you're concerned about civility - please."
"We've got to dispel this myth that bullying is just a normal rite of passage, that it's some inevitable part of growing up. It's not."
"So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty - trafficking and bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage. It's a politics that pretends to be brave and tough, when, in fact, it's born of fear."
The budget is more than simply numbers on a page. It is a measure of how well we are living up to our obligations to ourselves and one another. It is a test for our commitment to making America what it was always meant to be: a place where all things are possible for all people.
"Today, I authorized two operations in Iraq, targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water and facing almost certain death."
Probably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya.
"Good evening, everybody."
I would like to welcome you all to the ten-day anniversary of my first 100 days.
"Seventy-one years ago, on a bright cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed."
"But among those nations like my own that hold nuclear stockpiles, we must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them."
"Speaking honestly, the outcome of that decision is a matter of deep interest to the United States because it affects our prospects as well. The United States wants a strong United Kingdom as a partner. And the United Kingdom is at its best when it's helping to lead a strong Europe."
"It's not that different from us trying to detect the next mass shooter. You don't always see it. They're not always communicating publicly. And if you're not catching what they say publicly, then it becomes a challenge."
"Keep in mind it was only a couple of years ago where we were having a major debate about whether the government was becoming too much like Big Brother. And overall, I think we've struck the right balance."
So much of our steady persistent work over the years is paying off for the American people in big tangible ways.
"John Boehner did a favor to all of us, including now Speaker Ryan, by working with us to agree on a top-line budget framework. That was the basis for subsequent negotiations. He was able to do that because he was going out the door."
"We are, you know, essentially at this point detaining a handful of people, and each person is costing several million dollars."
"Since taking this office, I've never been more optimistic about a year ahead than I am right now. And in 2016, I'm going to leave it out all on the field."
This is an attack not just on Paris. It's an attack not just on the people of France. But this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share.
France is our oldest ally. The French people have stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States time and again. Now we want to be very clear that we stand together with them in the fight against terrorism and extremism.
We're going to do whatever it takes to work with the French people and with nations around the world to bring these terrorists to justice and to go after any terrorist networks that go after our people.
And those values are going to endure far behind any act of terrorism or the hateful vision of those who perpetrated the crimes this evening.
It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil.
"When a government gets in the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread."
We count on the press to shed light on the most important issues of the day.
"I'm hoping you think it's wrong to hear people spend years, months vilifying people, questioning their patriotism, calling them enemies of the people. And then suddenly, you're concerned about civility."
"Now, let's be clear. This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix."
"Because of how important this election is, I also want you to know that I am supporting Emmanuel Macron to lead you forward. En marche. Vive le France."
"And in the words of scripture, heal the brokenhearted, and bind up their wounds."
We have been very clear to the Assad regime but also to other players on the ground that a redline for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.
What we are expecting is that the Russian leadership will see once again that its actions in Ukraine have consequences.
"We also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections, and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasn't worked."
Ten days ago John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. I do not think that they are.
"I will do that. John, 10 days ago you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound, and..."
"John, it's been your president, who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time, who presided over this increase in spending, this orgy of spending, and enormous deficits. And you voted for almost all of his budgets."
"John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003. And at that time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong. You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni, and you were wrong."
"What the next president has to do, and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe, is to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams."
"I'll be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own defense."
I'm going to go for the classic mint chocolate chip.
"Triangulating poll-driven positions because we're worried about what Mitt or what Rudy might say about us just won't do. If we are serious, really serious about winning this election, Democrats, we can't live in fear of losing it."
We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.
"If we can set it up so that you can't unlock your phone unless you've got the right fingerprint, why can't we do the same thing for our guns?"
"If a child can't open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure that they can't pull a trigger on a gun."
"Thanksgiving reminds us that no matter our differences, we're still one people part of something bigger than ourselves."
"It was the right thing to do. And by the way, it will actually help the state's finances."
...Will continue to seek ways to increase the independence of the Cuban people.
"When I talk to my daughters and their friends, I think they are more tolerant, more welcoming of people who are different than them, more sophisticated about different cultures and what's happening around the world."
"I just want to emphasize to everybody that this is still a really dangerous hurricane, that the potential for storm surge flooding, loss of life and severe property damage continues to exist."
"You know, one of the most disturbing things about this election is just the unbelievable rhetoric coming at the top of the Republican ticket. I don't need to repeat it. There are children in the room."
...That African-American history is not somehow separate from our larger American story. It's not the underside of the American story. It is central to the American story.
In the Middle East we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights and support stable transitions to democracy.
"Yeah, we had seen - yeah, we have pretty good intelligence. We watched."
We knew that he was planning to provide the military assistance that Assad was needing because they were nervous about a potential eminent collapse of the regime.
"Young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard, their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives. And America will wrap everyone who's grieving with our prayers and our love."
"We've become numb to this. We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun."
I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws and to save lives and to let young people grow up. And that will require a change of politics on this issue.
"Because if they do, there's incredible talent and resources and sophistication inside of Iran, and it would be a very successful regional power that was also abiding by international norms and international rules. And that would be good for everybody."
Look at how excited this little girl is to meet the president.
We've go to get the chicken to the White House.
"You can see the results here. Now, just because the houses are nice doesn't mean our job's done."
"Today, this new community center stands as a symbol of the extraordinary resilience of this city, the extraordinary resilience of its people, the extraordinary resilience of the entire Gulf Coast and of the United States of America. You are an example of what is possible when, in the face of tragedy and in the face of hardship, good people come together."
"When almost 40 percent of children still live in poverty in this city, that's not a finished job. That's not a full recovery. Our work won't to be done when a typical black household earns half the income of white households in this city. The work's not done yet."
"The violent crime rate in America has been lower during my presidency than any time in the last three, four decades."
"We will win this fight by staying true to our values - values of pluralism and rule of law and diversity - and freedoms, like the freedom of religion, freedom of speech and assembly."
They need all the love and support from our American family as they grapple with an unimaginable loss.
"And of course, I'm the first Kenyan-American to be president of the United States."
He gets us. (Speaking Swahili). He's one of us.
"She said she wanted her boys to join her - to protest the incidence of black men being killed. She also said to the Dallas PD, thank you for being heroes. And today, her 12-year-old son wants to be a cop when he grows up."
"We also know what Chief Brown has said is true, that so much of the tensions between police departments and minority communities that they serve is because we ask the police to do too much and we ask too little of ourselves."
"Faced with this violence, we wonder if the divides of race in America can ever be bridged. We wonder if an African-American community that feels unfairly targeted by police and police departments that feel unfairly maligned for doing their jobs can ever understand each other's experience."
Today in this audience I see people who have protested on behalf of criminal justice reform grieving alongside police officers. I see people who mourn for the five officers we lost but also weep for the families of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. In this audience I see what's possible.
"Americans of all races and all backgrounds are rightly outraged by the inexcusable attacks on police, whether it's in Dallas or anyplace else."
"And the fact that we're aware of it may increase some anxiety right now, and hurt and anger, but it's been said sunshine's the best disinfectant. By seeing it, by people feeling a sense of urgency about it, by the larger American community realizing that, gosh, maybe this is a problem - and we've seen even some very conservative commentators begin to acknowledge this is something maybe we need to work on. That promises the possibility of actually getting it done."
"I strongly believe that it is in our national security interest, especially after all the blood and treasure we've invested in Afghanistan over the years, that we give our Afghan partners the very best opportunity to succeed."
"Many of our allies and partners have already stepped forward with commitments of troops and funding so that we can keep strengthening Afghan forces through the end of this decade. The NATO summit will be an opportunity for more allies and partners to affirm their contributions, and I'm confident they will."
"This is where al-Qaida is trying to regroup. This is where ISIL continues to try to expand its presence. If these terrorists succeed in regaining areas and camps where they can train and plot, they will attempt more attacks against us."
"I make an absolute commitment that we will do everything we need to do to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. One of the things we have to try, though, is to talk directly to Iran. That's something that we have not been doing."
And I have no doubt that 10 or 15 years from now the person who holds this office will be in a far stronger position with Iran further away from a weapon and with the inspections and transparency that allow us to monitor the Iranian program.
"People in Puerto Rico need to know that they're not forgotten, that they're part of the American family, and Congress's responsiveness to this issue, even though this is not a perfect bill, at least moves us in the right direction."
"My choice for the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Joe Dunford, is one of the most admired officers in our military."
"I have been extraordinarily impressed by Joe from the situation room, where he helped to shape our enduring commitment to Afghanistan, to my visit last year to Bagram, where I saw his leadership firsthand. I know Joe. I trust him."
"There's been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit-vote, as if somehow NATO's gone (laughter), and the transatlantic alliance is dissolving, and every country is rushing off to its own corner. And that's not what's happening."
"I'm confident that we can and we will defeat those who offer only death and destruction, and we will always remember, even as there are those who are trying to divide us, that we are stronger when we come together and work toward a better world together."
Somebody who labels us versus them or engages in rhetoric about how we're going to look after ourselves and take it to the other guy - that's not the definition of populism.
"Really interested in the possibilities, the prospect of bipartisan legislation around the criminal justice system."
The notion that the answer to this tragedy would be to make sure that more people in a nightclub are similarly armed to the killer defies common sense.
"Unfortunately Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to allow a simple yes or no vote on that bill. So I was left with little choice but to take steps within my existing authority to make our immigration system smarter, fairer and more just."
We don't have to wall ourselves off from those who may not look like us right now or pray like we do or have a different last name because being an American is about something more than that.
"Speaking honestly, the outcome of that decision is a matter of deep interest to the United States because it affects our prospects as well. The United States wants a strong United Kingdom as a partner. And the United Kingdom is at its best when it's helping to lead a strong Europe."
"Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual, like those in Aurora and Newtown, to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons, and they can do so legally."
"This is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. No act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans."
There's no magic to the phrase radical Islam. It's a political talking point. It's not a strategy.
And that kind of yapping has not prevented folks across government from doing their jobs.
"If we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims with a broad brush and imply that we are at war with an entire religion, then we are doing the terrorists' work for them."
"One team, one nation - those are the values that ISIL's trying to destroy, and we shouldn't help them do it."
Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.
"Look; I know how hard this job can be. That's why I know Hillary will be so good at it. In fact, I don't think there's ever been someone so qualified to hold this office. She's got the courage, the compassion and the heart to get the job done. And I say that as somebody who had to debate her more than 20 times."
"Look, I know how hard this job can be. That's why I know Hillary will be so good at it. In fact, I don't think there's ever been someone so qualified to hold this office."
"But among those nations, like my own, that hold nuclear stockpiles, we must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them."
"The job's not done in reducing conflict, building institutions of peace and reducing the prospect of nuclear war in the future."
With profound gratitude...
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: With a deep awareness of the responsibility...
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I again proudly...
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: I proudly...
...Your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
"Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad."
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Chris Van Hollen met with NRA lobbyists to craft a loophole that would let the NRA...
We remain deeply concerned about the upsurge in fighting in Syria over the last several days. And we continue to agree that the only real durable solution is a political solution that moves Syria towards an inclusive government that represents all Syrians.
Probably the biggest area where there's been tactical differences has been with respect to Iran.
"We're not naive, but as I pointed out during the height of the Cold War, both the Democratic presidents like John F. Kennedy and Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan still negotiated with the Soviet Union."
"These women first organized in 1912 with little money, but big hopes for equality for women all around the world. They wanted an equal say over their children, over their property, their earnings, their inheritance, equal rights to their citizenship and a say in their government, equal opportunities in schools and universities, workplaces, public service and yes, equal pay for equal work."
"After women won the right to vote, Alice Paul, who lived most of her life in this very house, said, it is incredible to me that any woman should consider the right for full equality won. It has just begun. And that's the thing about America - we are never finished. We are a constant work in progress."
"The journalists, like Bob Cox, who bravely reported on human rights abuses despite threats to them and their families."
"I've got two young daughters who are growing up a little too fast, and I want them to have the freedom to move and to travel around the world without the possibility that they'd be killed."
"There's no more important item on my agenda than going after them and defeating them. The issue is, how do we do it in an intelligent way?"
They do not feel ghettoized. They do not feel isolated. Their children are our children's friends going to the same schools. They are our colleagues in our workplaces.
"I just left a country that engages in that kind of neighborhood surveillance, which, by the way, the father of Sen. Cruz escaped for America, the land of the free."
"We defeat them in part by saying, you are not strong. You are weak. We send a message to those who might be inspired by them to say you are not going to change our values."
"My goal was to actually confirm a justice who I thought could do an outstanding job, and Merrick Garland fits that bill."
"In the aftermath of that act of terror, when 168 people, many of them small children, were murdered, Merrick had one evening to say goodbye to his own young daughters before he boarded a plane to Oklahoma City. And he would remain there for weeks. He worked side-by-side with first responders, rescue workers, local and federal law enforcement. He'd led the investigation and supervised the prosecution that brought Timothy McVeigh to justice."
"Over my seven years as president, in all my conversations with senators from both parties in which I asked their views on qualified Supreme Court nominees - this includes the previous two seats that I had to fill - the one name that has come up repeatedly from Republicans and Democrats alike is Merrick Garland."
He walked away from a comfortable and lucrative law practice to return to public service.
"I don't want to pass this problem on to the next president, whoever it is. And if, as a nation, we don't deal with this now, when will we deal with it?"
"Is there a separate executive order, Greg, with respect to how we're going to dispose of the detainees. Is that ready?"
We will be setting up a process whereby this is going to be taking place.
"It adheres to last year's bipartisan budget agreement. It drives down the deficit. It includes smart savings on health care, immigration, tax reform."
"By the way, Thomas Jefferson's opponents tried to stir things up by suggesting he was a Muslim, so I was not the first."
"If we're serious about freedom of religion - and I'm speaking now to my fellow Christians, who remain the majority in this country - we have to understand an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths."
There is a battle of hearts and mind that takes place - that is taking place right now. And American Muslims are better positioned than anybody to show that it is possible to be faithful to Islam and to be part of a pluralistic society.
"If you're ever wondering whether you fit in here, let me say it as clearly as I can. As president of the United States, you fit in here - right here. You're right where you belong. You're part of America, too."
I'm anticipating a Democrat succeeding. I'm confident in the wisdom of the American people on that front.
"I've gotten to know Hillary really well, and she is a good, smart, tough person who cares deeply about this country."
"Bernie is somebody who, although I don't know as well because he wasn't, obviously, in my administration, has the virtue of saying exactly what he believes."
The relevant contrast is not between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. The relevant contrast is between Bernie and Hillary and Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.
"And I know that if I was a parent up there, I would be beside myself that my kids health could be at risk."
It's one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.
"Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over."
"In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping ISIL's advance."
"Today, it is American that stands strong and united with our allies while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters. That's how America leads - not with bluster but with persistent, steady resolve."
"When what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try something new."
"Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies, including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict."
"Since I've been president, we've worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half. Now it is time to finish the job, and I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not who we are. It's time to close Gitmo."
"Our unalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Those rights were stripped from college kids in Blacksburg, in Santa Barbara and from high schoolers at Columbine and from first graders in Newtown."
"Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad."
"This is not a plot to take away everybody's guns. You pass a background check. You purchase a firearm. The problem is, some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked."
"The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they cannot hold America hostage."
We do not have to accept this carnage as the price of freedom.
It will potentially save lives in this country and spare families the pain and the extraordinary loss that they've suffered as a consequence of a firearm being in the hands of the wrong people.
"As I said just a few months ago and I said a few months before that and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough."
It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.
"They're no longer getting the same bargain that they got when they were going to a factory, able to support their families on a single paycheck."
"You combine those things, and it means that there is going to be potential anger, frustration, fear, some of it justified but just misdirected. And you know, I think somebody like Mr. Trump's taking advantage of that. I mean, that's what he's exploiting during the course of his campaign."
What matters most to all of us are our friends and our families and our communities and their safety.
"I want every American to know, as you go about the holidays, as you travel and gather with family and the kids open their presents, as you ring in the new year, that you've got dedicated patriots working around the clock all across the country to protect us all."
"They're less likely to be able to carry out large, complex attacks, but as we saw in San Bernardino, obviously, you can still do enormous damage."
"We're going to have to recognize that no government is going to have the capacity to read every single person's texts or e-mails or social media. If it's not posted publicly, then there are going to be feasibility issues that are -that are probably insurmountable at some level. And, you know, it raises questions about our values."
"I'm not wild about everything in it. I'm sure that's true for everybody. But it is a budget that, as I insisted, invests in our military and our middle class without ideological provisions that would've weakened Wall Street reform or rules on big polluters."
"I'm not going to be forward-leaning on what I can do without Congress before I've tested what I can do with Congress. And every once in a while, they'll surprise you."
This agreement represents the best chance we've had to save the one planet that we've got.
"Right now, people on the no-fly list can walk into a store and buy a gun. That's insane."
What could possibly be the argument for allowing a terrorist suspect to buy a semi-automatic weapon? It is a matter of national security.
That's how we can send a message to all those who would try to hurt us. We are Americans who will uphold our values in our free and open society. We are strong and we are resilient and we will be not be terrorized.
"If Congress believes, as I do, that we are at war with ISIL, it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of military force against these terrorists."
"It is entirely possible that these two attackers were radicalized to commit this act of terror. And if so, it would underscore a threat we've been focused on for years."
"It is possible that this was terrorist-related, but we don't know. It's also possible that this was workplace-related."
"It is possible that this was terrorist related, but we don't know. It's also possible that this was workplace related."
"Before long, we are going to have to devote more and more and more of our economic and military resources not to growing opportunity for our people but to adapting to the various consequences of a changing planet. This is an economic and security imperative that we have to tackle now."
I don't expected that their - you're going to see a 180 turn on their strategy over the next several weeks. They have invested four years now in keeping Assad in power. Their presence there is predicated on propping him up.
"Even if somebody from a different party succeeded me, one of the things that you find is, when you're in this job, you think about it differently than when you're just running for the job."
Your credibility and America's ability to influence events depends on taking seriously what other countries care about.
"It's a problem that, by definition, is just about the hardest thing for any political system to absorb because the effects are gradual. They're diffuse. People don't feel it immediately, and so there's not a lot of constituency pressure on politicians to do something about it right away."
"There is such a thing as being too late, and when it comes to climate change, that hour is almost upon us."
"One of the enemies that we'll be fighting at this conference is cynicism, the notion we can't do anything about climate change."
"We know that if we put our best minds behind it and we have the dollars behind it, we'll discover what works."
"We salute the people of Paris for insisting this crucial conference go on, an act of defiance that proves nothing will deter us from building the future we want for our children."
We're here today to declare that the United States and France stand united in total solidarity to deliver justice to these terrorists and those who sent them and to defend our nations.
Many of these refugees are the victims of terrorism themselves. That's what they're fleeing. Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our values.
"And let's assumed that we were to send 50,000 troops into Syria. What happens when there's a terrorist attack generated from Yemen? Do we then send more troops into there or Libya, perhaps, or if there's a terrorist network that's operating anywhere else in North Africa or in Southeast Asia?"
"Day after day, month after month, he pushed himself to his limit. He knew that every long run, every sprint, every interval could help shave a second or two off his times. And as he'd find out later, a few seconds can make all the difference."
"On his very worst day, he managed to summon his very best. That's the nature of courage - not being unafraid but confronting fear and danger and performing in a selfless fashion."
This pipeline would neither be a silver bullet for the economy - as was promised by some - nor the express lane to climate disaster proclaimed by others.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"It's no secret that the prime minister and I have had a strong disagreement on this narrow issue. But we don't have a disagreement on the need to making sure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon, and we don't have a disagreement about the importance of us blunting destabilizing activities that Iran may be taking place."
It is my strong belief that Israel has not just the right but the obligation to protect itself.
"If we're going to prevent large parts of this Earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we're going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them."
"This pipeline would neither be a silver bullet for the economy, as was promised by some, nor the express lane to climate disaster proclaimed by others."
"America's now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change. And, frankly, improving this project would have undercut that global leadership. And that's the biggest risk we face."
We can't dismiss people out of hand simply because of a mistake that they made in the past.
I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria. I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.
"American forces will not be returning to combat in Iraq, but we will help Iraqis as they take the fight to terrorists who threaten the Iraqi people, the region and American interests as well."
"Here's what you have to do. You have to make sure that it - that anybody who you are voting for is on the right side of this issue. And if they're not - even if they're great on other stuff, for a couple of election cycles you've got to vote against them and let them know precisely why you're voting against them."
"Like terrorists and tyrants throughout history, ISIL will eventually lose because it has nothing to offer but suffering and death."
"Defeating ISIL requires, I believe, a new leader and an inclusive government that unites the Syrian people in the fight against terrorist groups."
"When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a matter of one nation's internal affairs. It breeds human suffering on an order of magnitude that it affects us all."
"Yes, realism dictates that compromise will be required to end the fighting and ultimately stamp out ISIL. But realism also requires a managed transition away from Assad into a new leader."
I believe we can bridge our differences and choose cooperation over conflict. That is not weakness. That is strength.
"In your humility, your embrace of simplicity, in the gentleness of your words, in the generosity of your spirit, we see a living example of Jesus's teachings."
"He's very concerned about the spread of Boko Haram and the violence that's taken place there and the atrocities that they've carried out, and has a very clear agenda in defeating Boko Haram and extremism of all sorts inside of his country."
And he has a very clear agenda with the respect to rooting out the corruption that too often has held back the economic growth and prosperity of this country.
"Obviously Republicans had a good night and they deserve credit for running good campaigns. Beyond that, I'll leave it to all of you and the professional pundits to pick through yesterday's results."
"Old I may be, but given the chance, I will learn. I will begin a second youth alongside my progeny. I will recite the hadith of love of country with such fervor as to make each word bear life."
"Our kids only get one shot at a decent education. They cannot afford to wait any longer. So given that Congress cannot act, I am acting."
Starting today...
"Peace depends upon compromise among people who must live together long after our speeches are over, long after our votes have been tallied."
"Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the United Nations. If it were that easy, it would have been accomplished by now. Ultimately it is the Israelis and the Palestinians who must live side by side."
Let us be honest with ourselves. Israel is surrounded by neighbors that have waged repeated wars against it. Israel's citizens have been killed by rockets fired at their houses and suicide bombs on their buses.
I wouldn't mind taking a few classes here.
"For masons and concrete workers and carpenters and plumbers and electricians, and many of those jobs are filled by the good people of Columbus, Ohio."
"If Congress refuses to pass this bill, then middle-class families will get hit with a tax increase at the worst possible time. Now, we can't - we can't let that happen. Some folks have been working pretty hard to keep tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. Tell them they need to fight just as hard, they need to fight harder for middle-class families. Tell them to pass this jobs bill."
"Here's the other thing, Columbus: We've got to make sure that everybody pays their fair share, including the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations."
This next provision is called The Jersey Shore-Up. It reads: The following individuals shall be excluded from the Indoor Tanning Tax within this bill.
"Snooki, JWoww, The Situation and House Minority Leader John Boehner."
"You're passing rows of kids with flags and grandparents in their lawn chairs and mechanics out in front of their shops and, you know, farmers waving from their fields, and it inspires you. 'Cause it reminds you about what makes this country so great."
"Yeah, somebody had like an old flyer I'd send him. I looked so young."
And so it's a very practical way of thinking about these problems. It's not either/or. It's a recognition that the prime driver of economic growth and jobs is going to be our people and the private sector and our businesses. But you know what? Government can help. Government can make a difference.
"I can't force them to do it. You can force them to do it. And I will take my case to the American people that this vision is how we move the country forward. And if they've got an alternative vision and they don't want to sit there and do nothing for the next 16 months while unemployment is still high and small businesses are still suffering, then ultimately they're going to be held to account by you, just like I'm going to be held to account by you."
All right...
I strongly believe we should fix our broken immigration system.
"Fix it so that it meets our 21st century economic and security needs. And I want to work with Democrats and Republicans, yes, to protect our borders and enforce our laws, and address the status of millions of undocumented workers."
"We have redesigned our enforcement practices under the law to make sure that we're focusing primarily on criminals. And so our deportation of criminals are up about 70 percent, our deportation of non-criminals are down, and that's because we want to focus our resources on those folks who are destructive to the community."
We've done DNA sampling and testing and so there is no doubt that we killed Osama bin Laden.
"It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence, as a propaganda tool. You know, that's not who we are."
We don't have time for games. We don't have time for trying to score political points or maneuvering or positioning. Not on this.
"And if that doesn't work, we'll invite them again the day after that."
"There are going to be, I think, very sharply contrasting visions in terms of where we should move the country. That's a legitimate debate to have. By the way, part of the reason that debate's going to be important is because that's where 88 percent of the budget is."
"The task that I assigned our forces, to protect the Libyan people from immediate danger, and to establish a no-fly zone, carries with it a UN mandate and international support. It's also what the Libyan opposition asked us to do. If we tried to overthrow Gadhafi by force, our coalition would splinter."
Right now the industry holds tens of millions of acres of leases where they're not producing a single drop. They're just sitting on supplies of American energy that are ready to be tapped.
"I think history will end up recording that at every juncture in the situation in Egypt, that we were on the right side of history."
I find it ironic that you've got the Iranian regime pretending to celebrate what happened in Egypt when in fact they have acted in direct contrast to what happened in Egypt by gunning down and beating people who were trying to express themselves peacefully in Iran.
"If you look at the history of how these deals get done, typically it's not because there's an Obama plan out there. It's because Democrats and Republicans are both committed to tackling this issue in a serious way."
"Look, I was glad to see yesterday Republican leaders say: How come he didn't talk about entitlements? I think that's progress, because what we had been hearing made it sound as if - if we just slashed deeper on education or, you know, other provisions in domestic spending, that somehow that alone was going to solve the problem."
This is not a matter of you go first or I go first. This is a matter of everybody having a serious conversation about where we want to go and then ultimately getting in that boat at the same time so it doesn't tip over. And I think that can happen.
"I think people should be careful about, you know, being too loose in terms of talking about a government shutdown, because this has - this is not an abstraction. You know, people don't get their Social Security checks. They don't get their veterans payments."
"While we are absolutely committed to working with Democrats and Republicans to find further savings and to look at the whole range of budget issues, we can't sacrifice our future in the process."
"Education is an investment that we need to win the future, just like innovation is an investment that we need to win the future, just like infrastructure is an investment that we need to win the future."
"He said there is no room for second place. There's only one place in my game, and that's first place."
That's the kind of determination to win that America needs to show right now. That's what we need to show. We need to win the future.
"A lot of times Wall Street doesn't necessarily want to take a chance on a good idea until they've seen it proven. Sometimes the research that's required, nobody wants to pay for it. And that's where we have to step in."
"Her husband Mark is here and he allows me to share this with you. Right after we went to visit, a few minutes after we left her room and some of her colleagues from Congress were in the room, Gabby opened her eyes for the first time."
Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.
"I have come here tonight as an American who, like all Americans, kneels to pray with you today and will stand by you tomorrow."
Our hearts are broken by their sudden passing. Our hearts are broken - and yet our hearts also have reason for fullness.
"And Daniel, I'm sorry, you may deny it, but we've decided you are a hero because you ran through the chaos to minister to your boss, and tended to her wounds and helped keep her alive."
"If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate, as it should, let's make sure it's worthy of those we have lost."
Let's make sure it's not on the usual plane of politics and point scoring and pettiness that drifts away in the next news cycle.
"We may not be able to stop all evil in the world, but I know that how we treat one another, that's entirely up to us."
"And I believe that for all our imperfections, we are full of decency and goodness, and that the forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us."
I want to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it. All of us - we should do everything we can to do to make sure this country lives up to our children's expectations.
"A lot of folks in this town predicted that after the midterm elections, Washington would be headed for more partisanship and more gridlock. And instead this has been a season of progress for the American people."
"So I think it's fair to say that this has been the most productive post-election period we've had in decades, and it comes on the heels of the most productive two years that we've had in generations."
"If there's any lesson to draw from these past few weeks, it's that we are not doomed to endless gridlock. We've shown in the wake of the November elections that we have the capacity not only to make progress, but to make progress together."
"I'm willing to serve my country, I'm willing to fight for this country, I want to go to college and better myself, and I'm at risk of deportation. And it is heartbreaking. That can't be who we are."
"One thing I hope people have seen during this lame duck, I am persistent."
My sense is the Republicans recognize that with greater power is going to come greater responsibility. And some of the progress that I think we saw in the lame duck was a recognition on their part that people are going to be paying attention to what they're doing as well as what I'm doing and what the Democrats in Congress are doing.
The American people are driving the car. They're the ones who are going to be making an assessment as to whether we're putting in place policies that are working for them. And both parties are going to be held accountable and I'm going to be held accountable if we take a wrong turn on that front.
"A long political fight that carried over into next year might have been good politics, but it would be a bad deal for the economy and it would be a bad deal for the American people."
"I think it's tempting not to negotiate with hostage-takers, unless the hostage gets harmed. Then people will question the wisdom of that strategy. In this case, the hostage was the American people and I was not willing to see them get harmed."
"I mean the truth of the matter is, from the Republican perspective, the earned income tax credit, the college tuition tax credit, the child tax credit, all those things that are so important for so many families across the country, those are things they really opposed."
"I couldn't go through the front door at this country's founding. And you know, if we were really thinking about ideal positions, we wouldn't have a union. So my job is to make sure that we have a North Star out there, what is helping the American people live out their lives."
"American taxpayers are now positioned to recover more than my administration invested in GM, and that's a very good thing."
"Many advanced economies are growing too slowly and not creating enough jobs. Some countries are running large surpluses, others running large deficits. Put simply, we risk slipping back into the old imbalances that contributed to the economic crisis in the first place and which threaten global recovery."
"So I want everybody to get out there, knock on doors, make phone calls, volunteer."
"If you're going to the barbershops and the beauty shops, talking to your friends and talking to your neighbors..."
I need you to get out and vote in this election...
"...because if you do, if you're willing to step up, if you're willing to try..."
"...we will restore our economy. We will rebuild our middle class, and we will reclaim the American dream for future generations. God bless you."
And God bless the United States of America.
"We're not seeing that from the other party. I guess there feeling cocky, maybe."
"The Republican leader of the House says: ""This is not a time for compromise."" That's a quote. The Republican leader in the Senate said his main goal for the next two years - his top priority is to win the next election and to beat me."
"I served with Mark in the United States Senate, and..."
...and so I know this man. And I know that he has been fighting for the people of this state his entire career. You know what kind of leader he is.
Yeah.
"This time, we should draw upon the teachings of tolerance that lie at the heart of three great religions that see Jerusalem's soil as sacred. This time, we should reach for what's best within ourselves. If we do, when we come back here next year, we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the United Nations - an independent, sovereign state of Palestine, living in peace with Israel."
"Israel is a sovereign state, and the historic homeland of the Jewish people. It should be clear to all that efforts to chip away at Israel's legitimacy will only be met by the unshakable opposition of the United States."
"Israel's settlement moratorium has made a difference on the ground, and improved the atmosphere for talks. Our position on this issue is well known. We believe that the moratorium should be extended. We also believe that talks should press on until completed."
Let me start by being extremely clear: I am 100 percent committed to the mission of NASA and its future.
There's a lot more of space to explore and a lot more to learn when we do.
"Nuclear weapons are not simply an issue for the United States and Russia. They threaten the common security of all nations. A nuclear weapon in the hands of a terrorist is a danger to people everywhere, from Moscow to New York, from the cities of Europe to South Asia."
Those nations that follow the rules will find greater security and opportunity. Those nations that refuse to meet their obligations will be isolated.
"There have been a handful of African-American leaders who've been critical. They were critical when I was running for president. So there's always going to be somebody who's critical of the president of the United States. That's my job, in part is - particularly when the economy is going as badly as it is right now - people are going to have concerns and they should."
"If we want startups here and if we want established companies, like a DuPont or a Eli Lily to continue to make products here and hire here, then we're going to have to be able to compete with any other country around the world. So this patent bill will encourage that innovation."
"But as I have said for the moment that I walked into the door of this White House, it took years for us to get into this mess, and it will take us more than a few months to turn it around."
We are going to get through this. Things will get better and we're going to get there together.
"And Michelle, you know, says that, you know, she still thinks I'm cute. You know, and I guess that's all that matters, doesn't it?"
"It's another Washington-inflicted wound on America, and Congress needs to break that impasse now, hopefully before the Senate adjourns, so these folks can get back to work."
"I think what's absolutely true is is that core commitments that we make to the most vulnerable have to be maintained. And so, a lot of the spending cuts that we're making should be around areas like defense spending, as opposed to food stamps."
"I think that there's some politics and, you know, compromising with me among some Republican leaders is bad politics for them. I also think that, in fairness, that the decisions we've got to make right not are tough ones and nobody likes them."
"Oh, that's funny, see, because I was just dialing out for pizza."
"You need to be like a family 'cause I'm assuming you have to share pretty cramped quarters and a bathroom. So, you know, my wife and my daughters are always crowding me out."
"I'm glad that congressional leaders don't want to default, but I think the American people expect more than that. They expect that we actually solve this problem, we get our fiscal house in order."
This is not an issue of salesmanship to the American people. The American people are sold.
"This is not a matter of the American people knowing what the right thing to do is, this is a matter of Congress doing the right thing and reflecting the will of the American people. And if we do that, we will have solved this problem."
We don't need a constitutional amendment to do our jobs. The Constitution already tells us to do our jobs.
"I think increasingly the American people are going to say to themselves, you know what, if a party or a politician is constantly taking the position my way or the highway, constantly being locked into, you know, ideologically rigid positions, that, you know, we're going to remember at the polls."
"Part of being a good friend is being honest. And I think there have been times where we are not as honest as we should be about the fact that the current direction, the current trajectory, in the region is profoundly negative. Not only for Israeli interests but also U.S. interests."
No. I don't think that we have to change strong U.S. support for Israel.
"Part of being a good friend is being honest. And I think there have been times where we are not as honest as we should be about the fact that the current direction - the current trajectory in the region is profoundly negative, not only for Israeli interests, but also U.S. interests."
"Well, keep in mind, I already spoke in Turkey. They have a democracy that I'm sure some Turks would say has flaws to it, just as there are some Americans who would suggest there are flaws to American democracy."
"No, no. What I'm about - don't put words in my mouth, Steve..."
...especially not in the White House. The...
"You can wait until the postscript. There is a wide range of governments throughout the Muslim world and the non-Muslim world. And the main thing for me to do is to project what our values are, what our ideals are, what we care most deeply about. And that is democracy - rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of religion. Now in every country I deal with, whether it's China, Russia, ultimately Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, allies as well as non- allies, there are going to be some differences. And what I want to do is just maintain consistency in affirming what those values that I believe in are, understanding that, you know, we're not going to get countries to embrace various of our values simply by lecturing or through military means."
"Well, let's just underscore our point, here. Iran is a huge, significant nation-state that has, you know, has, I think, across the international community, been recognized as such. Hezbollah and Hamas are not. And I don't think that we have to approach those entities in the same way. In the..."
"Well, look, they - if at some point Lebanon is a member of the United Nations, if at some point they are elected as a head of state, or a head of state is elected in Lebanon that is a member of that organization, then that would raise these issues. That hasn't happened yet."
Mm-hmm.
"But we have to be able to make that same argument to other countries that might aspire to nuclear weapons, and we have to apply some of those same principles to ourselves so that, for example, I'll be traveling next month to Moscow to initiate start talks, trying to reduce our nuclear stockpiles as part of a broader effort in the international community to contain our nuclear weapons."
"Well, that's going to be the challenge. That's why we're so busy around here all the time."
"But I am somebody who is very anxious to have the Afghan government and the Pakistani government have the capacity to ensure that those safe havens don't exist. And so, you know, and it's - I think will be an important reminder that we have no territorial ambitions in Afghanistan. We don't have an interest in exploiting the resources of Afghanistan. What we want is simply that people aren't hanging out in Afghanistan who are plotting to bomb the United States. And I think that's a fairly modest goal that, you know, other Muslim countries should be able to understand."
"And I don't in any way begrudge, I think, anybody in debating, sometimes ferociously, these issues that are of preeminent and importance to the United States."
Our economy as a whole just isn't producing nearly enough jobs for everybody who's looking.
"Even as there will be dark days ahead in Afghanistan, the light of a secure peace can be seen in the distance."
"These additional American and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011. Just as we have done in Iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground."
": We're joined now by NPR national political correspondent, Mara Liasson. And Mara, what is the significance of the speech tonight and what are we likely to hear in it?"
We remember that the blessings we enjoy as Americans came at a dear cost. That our very presence here today as free people in a free society bears testimony to their enduring legacy. Our nation owes a debt to its fallen heroes that we can never fully repay.
"We agreed that we have made progress on our Libya campaign, but that meeting the U.N. mandate of civilian protection cannot be accomplished when Gadhafi remains in Libya directing his forces in acts of aggression against the Libyan people. And we are joined in resolve to finish the job."
"Not only as they transition to democracy, but also ensuring that that democratic transition is accompanied by economic growth, which can provide more opportunities for all the people, particularly the young people, in the region."
"I know that a lot of people are wondering how they'll get through the coming days or months or even years. But I want everybody in Joplin, everybody in Missouri, everybody in Minnesota, everybody across the Midwest to know that we are here for you."
"In this new century, Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more, not less."
"Obviously, there are some differences between us in the precise formulations and language, and that's going to happen between friends."
"Obviously, there are some differences between us in the precise formulations and language and that's going to happen between friends. But what we are in complete accord about is that a true peace can only occur if the ultimate resolution allows Israel to defend itself against threats."
The Syrian people have shown their courage in demanding a transition to democracy. President Assad now has a choice. He can lead that transition or get out of the way.
"Let me just comment, first of all, on the fact that I can't get the networks to break in on all kinds of other discussions."
"We've had every official in Hawaii, Democrat and Republican, every news outlet that has investigated this confirm that, yes, in fact, I was born in Hawaii, August 4th, 1961 in Kapi'olani Hospital."
We're not going to be able to do it if we spend time vilifying each other. We're not going to be able to do it if we just make stuff up and pretend that facts are not facts. We're not going to be able to solve our problems if we get distracted by sideshows and carnival barkers.
"We had a surplus back in 2000, 11 short years ago. But then we cut taxes for everybody, including millionaires and billionaires, we fought two wars and we created a new and expensive prescription drug program and we didn't pay for any of it. And as the saying goes, there is no such thing as a free lunch."
"I want you to be able to talk to your members of Congress and say, yes, I'm serious about reducing the deficit. Yes, I want limited government. Yes, I want reductions in spending, but I do think that we've got to make investments in basic research and infrastructure and education and so let's do it in a balanced way."
"If people keep on having to finance America's debt, at a certain point they're going to start charging higher interest rates. We won't be able to afford investments in education or clean energy."
"And when folks in Washington agree on anything, that's a good sign. So the debate isn't about whether we reduce our deficit. The debate is about how we reduce our deficit. And my view is we need to live within our means while still investing in our future."
"I think America wants smart government, it wants a lean government, it wasn't a accountable government, but we don't want no government. I mean, according to the Republican budget that was passed, for example, we would have to eliminate transportation funding by a third."
"It's an approach that puts every kind of spending on the table, but one that protects the middle class, our promise to seniors and are investments in the future."
There's nothing serious about a plan that claims to reduce the deficit by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. And I don't think there's anything courageous about asking for sacrifice from those who can least afford it and don't have any clout on Capitol Hill. That's not a vision of the America I know.
Our approach lowers the government's health care bills by reducing the cost of health care itself.
"We are now closer than we have ever been to getting an agreement. There is no reason why we should not get an agreement. As I said before, we have now matched the number that the speaker originally sought. The only question is whether politics or ideology are going to get in the way of preventing a government shutdown."
The main message I have is that the statistics every day underscore the urgency of the economic situation. The American people expect action.
"I don't expect 100 percent agreement from my Republican colleagues, but I do hope that we can all put politics aside and do the American people's business right now."
"Today, I authorize the Armed Forces of the United States to begin a limited military action in Libya in support of an international effort to protect Libyan civilians. An action has now begun."
"In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by nine campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood..."
"""Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it."""
"Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."
"When the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. When the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government."
"It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job, which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate."
"This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed, why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent Mall, and why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath."
"I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear."
That I will execute...
the office of president to the United States faithfully.
And will to the best of my ability.
"We're going to be making some key investments in places like education and science and technology, research and development, that the American people understand is required to win the future. So what we've done is we've taken a scalpel to the discretionary budget, rather than a machete."
The presidency has a funny way of making a person feel the need to pray.
"Making our buildings more energy efficient is one of the fastest, easiest and cheapest ways to save money, combat pollution and create jobs right here in the United States of America. And that's what we're going to do."
"What we're saying to people is if you're willing to make your buildings more energy efficient, we'll provide new tax credits and financing opportunities for you to do so."
"In this country, from the moment you have a new idea, you can explore it in the world's best labs and universities. You can develop it with a research grant. You can protect it with a patent. You can market it with a loan to start a new business. You've got a chain that takes a great idea all the way through and that's something that we as a nation have always invested in."
They are doing just fine on their own.
"So it's time to stop subsidizing yesterday's energy, it's time to invest in tomorrow's. It's time to win the future. That's what our project is."
"We are making a big push with employers to say, these folks have shown leadership, they have been trained, they have performed at high levels in very difficult situations, they're going to be great assets to help rebuild the country."
"The overall jobs picture is still very tough out there. We created a million, point - 1,300,000 jobs last year in the private sector, which is a lot better than we had been doing. But it's still not enough."
"Well, you know, we're going to be announcing our budget, so I don't want to give too much details because then nobody pays attention when we actually put the numbers out."
"I think that it is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances. As I said in my State of the Union speech, there are certain core values that we believe in as Americans that we believe are universal - freedom of speech, freedom of expression."
Most of you hadn't heard of Samalkot.
"But now you need to know about it because you're going to be selling to Samalkot, India. And that new business halfway around the world is going to help support more than 1,200 manufacturing jobs and more than 400 engineering jobs right here in this community because of that sale."
"The past two years were about pulling our economy back from the brink. The next two years, our job now is putting our economy into overdrive."
We're going back to Thomas Edison's principles. We're going to build stuff and invent stuff.
"As business resumes, I look forward to working together in that same spirit of common cause with members of Congress from both parties, because before we are Democrats or Republicans, we are Americans."
"And I believe that for all our imperfections, we are full of decency and goodness and that the forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us."
"civility is not a sign of weakness. But if you actually look at the whole statement, he said, so let us begin a new remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness and sincerity is always subject to proof. And so what Kennedy was saying and I guess my attitude here is: hope, but verify."
"When I am president, I will make it absolutely clear that working in an Obama administration is not about serving your former employer, your future employer, or your bank account. It's about serving your country, and that's what comes first."
"It's been a long time coming, but tonight because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America."
"If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer."
"While the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress."
"As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, ""We are not enemies, but friends. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection."" And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your president too."
"To those who would tear the world down, we will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security, we support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright, tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope."
Now let me just ask something. Do you ever have small crowds in Denver?
How many people have early voted?
That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. No point waiting in lines if you don't have to. You know who you're going to vote for.
Go to the polls.
"But Senator McCain voted with President Bush 90 percent of the time over the last eight years. Just the other day, George Bush returned the favor and voted early for John McCain."
Keep in mind that for the last eight years we've tried it John McCain's way. We've tried it George Bush's way. We actually have an experiment in their economic theories over the last eight years. They have been tested. They have been found wanting.
"The change we need is not going to come easy. It's not going to come overnight. I mean, this administration has dug a deep hole for us. We've got a lot of debt, and we've got a lot of problems. And we're all going to need to tighten our belts, and we're all going to need to sacrifice."
"Bob, your network just did a poll showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine. And a hundred percent, John, of your ads - a hundred percent of them - have been negative."
"It absolutely is true. And now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply."
"Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House. And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me."
"Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. So the fact of the matter is that if I have occasionally mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush. Now, you've shown independence, commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example. And I give you enormous credit for that. But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you are proposing is eight more years of the same thing."
He's been watching some ads of Senator McCain's.
"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the Plumber, what I essentially said to him was, five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then."
(Unintelligible) tax cuts to Joe the Plumber before...
"And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there."
"The middle-class need a rescue package. And that means tax cuts for the middle-class. It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs. And then long-term, we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists."
"Senator McCain, I think the 'Straight Talk Express' lost a wheel on that one."
"I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans. 95 percent. If you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down. Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses. Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan."
"Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand. It's true. There are some things I don't understand. I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us. That was Sen. McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment. When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators. That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us."
"Wages and incomes have gone down. People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick. We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money. And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome. We need fundamental change. That's what's at stake in this election. That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America. But we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve, to move in a new direction."
"Before we go get barbecue, I just wanted to make a brief statement about the economy."
"And the notion that we would want to brush that aside and engage in the usual political shenanigans and smear tactics that have come to characterize too many political campaigns, I think is not what the American people are looking for..."
"In 30 days, you are going to elect the next president. And you deserve, and you need a president who's going to wake up every single day and fight for you, fight for the middle class, fight to create jobs and grow our economy again."
"Thank you, Elko. It is good to be back in Elko."
"I just got a football shirt from the football team in Elko, the Elko High School Indians. And so, the - it was about two sizes too big. I'm kind of a skinny guy."
I think it's a lineman shirt.
"I want you to argue with them and get in their face. And if they tell you that, well, we're not sure where he stands on guns, I want you to say he believes in the Second Amendment. If they tell you, well, he's going to raise your taxes, you say, no, he's not. He's going to lower them. You are my ambassadors."
"And I don't need to tell you folks here in Elko that your paychecks don't go as far as they used to. It has never been harder to save, or retire, to buy gas, or to buy groceries."
We can't steer ourselves out of this crisis by heading in the same direction.
"This is somebody who's been in congress for 26 years, who put seven of the most powerful Washington lobbyists in charge of his campaign. And now he tells us that he's the one who's going to take on the old boys' network. The old boys' network. In the McCain campaign, that's called a staff meeting."
"I ran for this office to tackle these challenges and give voice to the concerns of everyday people. Over the last two years we've made progress. But clearly too many Americans haven't felt that progress yet. And they told us that yesterday. And as president, I take responsibility for that."
I think we'd be misreading the election if we thought that the American people want to see us for the next two years re-litigate arguments that we had over the last two years.
"I think what's going to be useful is for us to go through, you know, the issues that Republicans have issues on. Not sort of talking generally, but let's talk specifics, you know. This particular provision, when it comes to preexisting conditions, is something you're for or you're against? Helping seniors get their prescription drugs, does that make sense or not?"
I'm not suggesting this will be easy. I won't pretend that we will be able to bridge every difference or solve every disagreement. There's a reason we have two parties in this country and both Democrats and Republicans who have certain beliefs and certain principles that each feels cannot be compromised.
It feels bad.
"You know, the toughest thing over the last couple of days is seeing really terrific public servants not have the opportunity to serve anymore, at least in the short term."
"My core responsibility is making sure that we've got an economy that's growing, a middle class that feels secure, that jobs are being created. And so I think I've got to take direct responsibility for the fact that we have not made as much progress as we need to make."
Tom has a wealth of experience that will serve him well in this new assignment. He has served three presidents and been immersed in our national security for decades. Over the last two years there's not a single critical national security issue that has not crossed Tom's desk.
"It's because of them and all those whose names never made it into the history books, those men and women young and old, black, brown, white, clear-eyed, straight-backed, who refused to settle for the world as it is, who had the courage to remake the world as it should be, it's because of them that I stand before you tonight as the Democratic nominee for president of the United States of America."
"We need societal responsibility and we need individual responsibility. We need politicians doing what they're supposed to do and CEOs doing what they're supposed to do, and we need parents doing what they're supposed to do."
That's how we'll truly honor those who came before us.
"The Bush/Cheney ticket won't be up for reelection, but Bush/Cheney policies will, because John McCain has decided that he is running for George Bush's third term in office. That's what his campaign has been about."
"If you become the president of the United States, Ms. Clinton, what about Ms. Clinton? Is she going to be your vice president?"
"What are you, a reporter? Or you a..."
"What I've said is I'm not going to talk about vice president this or vice president that until I've actually won. You know, it'd be presumptuous of me to pretend like I've already won and start talking about who my vice president's going to be. I've still got some more work to do, so - but I'll let you know."
"Two decades after the end of the Cold War, we face a cruel irony of history. The risk of a nuclear confrontation between nations has gone down but the risk of nuclear attack has gone up."
"Today, we are declaring that nuclear terrorism is one of the most challenging threats to international security. We also agreed that the most effective way to prevent terrorists and criminals from acquiring nuclear materials is through strong nuclear security, protecting nuclear materials and preventing nuclear smuggling."
"This is one part of a broader comprehensive agenda that the United States is pursuing, including reducing our nuclear arsenal and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, an agenda that will bring us closer to our ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons."
"When President Ford was faced with a Supreme Court vacancy shortly after the nation was still recovering from the Watergate scandal, he wanted a nominee who was brilliant, non-ideological, pragmatic and committed, above all, to justice, integrity and the rule of the law. He found that nominee in John Paul Stevens."
"Justice Stevens has courageously served his country from the moment he enlisted the day before Pearl Harbor to his long and distinguished tenure on the Supreme Court. During that tenure, he has stood as an impartial guardian of the law. He's worn the judicial robe with honor and humility."
"An independent mind, a record of excellence and integrity, a fierce dedication to the rule of law and a keen understanding of how the law affects the daily lives of the American people. It will also be someone who, like Justice Stevens, knows that in a democracy, powerful interests must not be allowed to drown out the voices of ordinary citizens."
The Republicans say that they've got a better way of doing it. So I want them to put it on the table.
"Don't let tell them tell you we got to wait. Our moment is now. See, I don't want to spend the next four years having the same old arguments and not getting nothing done in Washington. I don't want to pit red American against blue America. I want to be the president of the United States of America."
"And here's how it would work. Employers would get a tax credit of up to $5,000 for every employee they add in 2010. They'd get a tax break for increases in wages as well."
"And that's why you are all going to work just as hard as you can to make sure that he gets re-elected and is continuing to help me move this country forward. Thank you very much, Philadelphia."
I love you and I love Arlen Specter. I appreciate you...
"Working with my auto taskforce, GM and its stakeholders have produced a viable, achievable plan that will give this iconic American company a chance to rise again."
"Many experts said that a quick, surgical bankruptcy was impossible. They were wrong. Others predicted that Chrysler's decision to enter bankruptcy would lead to an immediate collapse in consumer confidence that would send car sales over a cliff - they were wrong, as well."
"Now, let me talk about this. I recognize that this may give some Americans pause."
"And when that happens, we can truly say that what is good for General Motors and all who work there is good for the United States of America."
"My single most important responsibility as president is to keep the American people safe. It's the first thing that I think about when I wake up in the morning, it's the last thing that I think about when I go to sleep at night."
"Now, let me be clear. We are indeed at war with al-Qaida and its affiliates. We do need to update our institutions to deal with this threat. But we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process, in checks and balances and accountability."
"They serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America."
"So the record's clear. Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security."
"You can almost picture the direct mail pieces that emerge from any vote on this issue, designed to frighten the population. I get it. But if we continue to make decisions within a climate of fear, we will make more mistakes. And if we refuse to deal with these issues today, then I guarantee you that there will be an albatross around our efforts to combat terrorism in the future."
"Because the terrorists can only succeed if they swell their ranks and alienate America from our allies. And they will never be able to do that if we stay true to who we are, if we forge tough and durable approaches to fighting terrorism that are anchored in our timeless ideals. This must be our common purpose."
We have our CIA Director Leon Panetta. We have our Secretary of Defense William Gates.
"Maybe, just maybe, this campaign can be the vehicle for people's hopes and dreams."
This campaign can present an opportunity for us to end the gridlock.
"There is a certain presumptuousness in this, a certain audacity to this announcement. I know that I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington, but I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change."
"The fact of the matter is, is that I have the most specific plan in terms of how to get out of Iraq of any candidate. I've written two books that have sold close to a million copies each that probably give people more insight into how I think and how I feel about the issues facing America than any candidate in the field. And the problem is not that the information is not out there, the problem is, is that's not what you guys have been reporting on. You've been reporting on how I look in a swimsuit."
"It indicates that even at the time it was possible to make judgments that this would not work out well. I feel good about the fact that my judgment was that we shouldn't be proceeding, and I think that speaks to hopefully the kind of judgment that I'll be bringing to the office of president as we move forward."
"With the Executive Order I am about to sign, we will bring the change that so many scientists and researchers; doctors and innovators; patients and loved ones have hoped for and fought for these past eight years. We will lift the ban on federal funding for promising embryonic stem cell research."
"We will support it only when it is both scientifically worthy and responsibly conducted. We will develop strict guidelines, which we will rigorously enforce, because we cannot ever tolerate misuse or abuse. And we will ensure that our government never opens the door to the use of cloning for human reproduction. It is dangerous, profoundly wrong, and has no place in our society or any society."
"Promoting science isn't just about providing resources, it's also about protecting free and open inquiry. It's about letting scientists, like those who are here today, do their jobs free from manipulation or coercion and listening to what they tell us even when it's inconvenient, especially when it's inconvenient."
"It is about ensuring that scientific data is never distorted or concealed to serve a political agenda, and that we make scientific decisions based on facts not ideology. By doing this..."
Roads like U.S. 31 here in Indiana.
"That Hoosiers can count on, that connect small towns and rural communities to opportunities for economic growth. And I know that a new overpass downtown would make a big difference for businesses and families right here in Elkhart."
"Now, let me be clear. I'm not going to tell you that this bill is perfect. It's coming out in Washington, it's going through Congress."
"You know, look - it's not perfect, but it is the right size, it is right scope. Broadly speaking, it has for right priorities to create jobs that will jump-start our economy and transform this economy for the 21st century."
"I would be lying to you if I did not say that right now, a part of me is with him. And I think that's true for all of us. This is a joyous time, but it's also a sobering time."
The story of this company - which began building wind-turbine parts just two years ago and is now poised to make half its earnings that way - is that renewable energy isn't something pie-in-the-sky. It's not part of a far-off future. It's happening all across America right now. It's providing alternatives to foreign oil right now.
"If we don't act now, because of the economic downturn, half of the wind projects planned for 2009 could end up being abandoned. Credit markets have frozen up. It's very difficult, because of the capital-intensive nature of these projects, for them to move forward if they can't get loans, if they can't get access to credit. And think about that; think about all the businesses that won't come to be, all the jobs that wouldn't be created, all the clean energy that we wouldn't produce."
"Given the magnitude of these challenges, none of this is going to come easy. Recovery is not going to happen overnight. It's likely that even with the reinvestment package that we're putting forward, even with the measures that we're taking, things could get worse before they get better. I want everybody to be realistic about this."
"We're not going to transform every school overnight. And there are some school systems - not just big city school systems - there are rural schools and suburban schools that just aren't up to snuff. But what we can expect is that each and every day, we are thinking of new, innovative ways to make the schools better."
"We are running out of the traditional ammunition that's used in a recession, which is to lower interest rates. They're getting to be about as low as they can go. And although the Fed is still going to have more tools available to it, it is critical that the other branches of government step up, and that's why the economic recovery plan is so absolutely critical."
"If we can get young people focused on education, if we can change our cultures so that we are once again valuing intellectual achievement, and if we are willing to all pull together around making our schools better, that's going to be the single biggest determinant in terms of how our economy does long-term."
I've said that I don't think the governor can serve effectively in his office. I'm going to let the state Legislature make a determination in terms of how they want to proceed.
"If we are going to make the investments we need, we also have to be willing to shed the spending that we don't need. In these challenging times, when we're facing both rising deficits and a shrinking economy, budget reform is not an option."
"Peter doesn't need a map to tell him where the bodies are buried in the federal budget. He knows what works and what doesn't, what's worthy of our precious tax dollars and what is not. Just because a program, a special interest tax break, or corporate subsidy is hidden in this year's budget, does not mean that it will survive the next."
"I think it's important, given the uncertainty in the markets and given the very legitimate anxiety that the American people are feeling, that they know that their new president has a plan and is going to act swiftly and boldly."
I don't think that there's any question that we have a mandate to move the country in a new direction and not continue the same old practices that have gotten us into the fix that we're in.
"I think what the American people want more than anything is just commonsense, smart government. They don't want ideology. They don't want bickering. They don't want sniping. They want action and they want effectiveness."
"Here's what I can guarantee you, that we are going to be hitting back hard. We have been hitting back hard, but we're hitting back on the issues that matter to families."
"Governor Palin's town of Wasilla has, I think, 50 employees. We've got 2,500 in this campaign. I think their budget is maybe $12 million a year. You know, we have a budget of about three times that, just for the month. So I think that our ability to manage large systems and to execute, I think, has been made clear over the past couple of years."
"It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, to look out for American workers and play by the rules of the road."
"And I'll invest $150 billion over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy, wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels, an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced."
"We should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude, which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks. Over the next five years, we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in Alaska for oil and gas production."
"I'm Barack Obama. America's a country of strong families and strong values. My life's been blessed by both. I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents. We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up."
"I approved this message because I'll never forget those values, and if I have the honor of taking the oath of office as president, it will be with a deep and abiding faith in the country I love."
"That starts with aggressive, principled, tough diplomacy without self-defeating preconditions, but with a clear-eyed understanding of our interests. We have no time to waste."
"The Palestinians need a state that is contiguous and cohesive, and that allows them to prosper. But any agreement with the Palestinian people must preserve Israel's identity as a Jewish state with secure, recognized, defensible borders. And Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided."
"If the plant moves to China and you've been working there for 20, 30 years and suddenly you have the rug pulled out from under you and you don't have healthcare and you don't have a pension, you're on your own."
"Forty-five minutes before we heard about health care, 45 minutes before we heard about Iraq, 45 minutes before we heard about jobs, 45 minutes before we heard about gas prices."
I was opposed to Iraq from the start.
"I think I would be the Democrat who would be most effective in going up against a John McCain, or any other Republican, because they all want basically a continuation of George Bush's policies. Because I will offer a pure contrast, somebody who never supported this war, thought it was a bad idea. I don't want to just end the war, but I want to end the mindset that got us into war in the first place. That's the kind of leadership I intend to provide..."
The authorization had the title: an authorization to use military force - U.S. military force - in Iraq. I think everybody the day after the vote was taken understood this was a vote potentially to go to war. I think people were very clear about that. That...
"We all know this is urgent. And unfortunately, over the course of the year, despite all the hearings that took place and all the negotiations that took place and people on both sides of the aisle worked long and hard on this issue, and you know, this became a very ideological battle. It became a very partisan battle, and politics, I think, ended up trumping practical common sense."
"...very useful tool for the vast majority of people who've got pre-existing conditions. Just because there's just not enough money that you guys put into it to be able to cover all the people with pre-existing conditions, which is why other states have high-risk pools, Kathleen mentioned."
"There are I don't know how many states, but let's say 20, 21 states currently have high-risk pools. Out of all those 21 states, about 200,000 people use the high-risk pool. And the reason is because by just dealing with older, less healthy individuals separately or people with pre-existing conditions, it is very, very expensive."
"Tom's point was if everybody's in it because presumably none of us know at any given moment who's going to end up being healthy and who's not, we don't know whether our kids are going to be suffering some sort of disease that we don't anticipate yet, or, you know, our spouses get ill, that if everybody's in it, then that drives prices down cheaper for everybody."
"So it's not that I think that the high-risk pool idea is a bad one. As I said, the House, the Senate bill, the bill - the proposal that I put forward, all use the high-risk pool as a stopgap measure to get to a broader pool, but the goal has to be to get everybody in in a place where those risks are spread more broadly."
"I gather - let me just guess. That's the 2,400-page health care bill. Is that right?"
Okay.
"Let me just make this point, John, because we're not campaigning anymore. The election's over. The..."
"...well, I - yeah. So the - we can spend the remainder of the time with our respective talking points going back and forth. We were supposed to be talking about insurance. You know, obviously, I'm sure that Harry Reid and Chris Dodd and others who went through an exhaustive process through the both the House and the Senate with the most hearings, the most debates on the floor, the longest markup in 22 years on each and every one these bills, would have a response for you."
"My concern is is that if we do that, then we're essentially back on Fox News or MSNBC on the split screen just arguing back and forth. So my hope would be that we can just focus on the issues of how we actually get a bill done. And this is probably a good time to turn it over to Secretary Sebelius, who..."
"Well, they absolutely..."
"They absolutely do care about it, John. And I think that the way you characterized it, obviously, would get some strong objections from the other side. We can have a debate about process, or we can have a debate about how we're actually going to help the American people at this point."
"One of the difficulties in dealing with Iran over the last several months is it's not always clear who's speaking on behalf of the government, and we get a lot of different mixed signals."
"But what's clear is, is that they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia, China, Germany, France, Great Britain and the United States all said was a good deal and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do and that Iran should accept."
"He directed the failed attempt to blow up an airplane on Christmas Day in 2009. He directed the failed attempt to blow up U.S. cargo planes in 2010. And he repeatedly called on individuals in the United States and around the globe to kill innocent men, women and children to advance a murderous agenda."
A red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.
I will seek authorization for the use of force from the American people's representatives in Congress.
We have communicated in no uncertain terms with every player in the region that that's a red line for us and that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing movement on the chemical weapons front or the use of chemical weapons.
"If we fail to act, the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons."
"After careful deliberation, I determined that it is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike."
"If by the end of this week we have not seen substantial progress, then I think members of Congress need to understand we are going to, you know, start having to cancel things and stay here until we get it done."
I think there's a conceptual framework that would allow us to make huge progress on our debt and deficit and do so in a way that does not hurt our economy right here and right now.
One of the important roles that Poland can play is not just as a promoter of ideas but as a living example of what is possible when countries take reform seriously.
"Today, we learned that we added 230,000 private sector jobs last month. And that's good news."
Everybody here knows we've got a lot of more work to do. There are still millions of Americans out there that are looking for a job that pays the bills.
"Given the encouraging news we received today on jobs, it would be the height of irresponsibility to halt our economic momentum because of the same old Washington politics. That's not what we need."
"Tonight, I can report to the American people, and to the world, that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida and a terrorist who's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women and children."
"Gadhafi must stop his troops from advancing on Benghazi, pull them back from Ajdabiya, Misurata, and Zawiyah, and establish water, electricity and gas supplies to all areas. Humanitarian assistance must be allowed to reach the people of Libya. Let me be clear, these terms are not negotiable."
"We will provide the unique capabilities that we can bring to bear to stop the violence against civilians, including enabling our European allies and Arab partners to effectively enforce a no-fly zone."
"As president, I know that I speak for all Americans when I say that we cannot wait for the moment when you are reunited and your son, Bowe, is back in your arms."
There's a lot of talk in Washington these days about creating jobs. But it doesn't help when those same folks turn around and risk losing hundreds of thousands of jobs just because of political gamesmanship. We need to pass this transportation bill and put people to work rebuilding America.
"And so, as a consequence, folks wake up and they're surprised - how come we can't get things through Congress? How come we can't get things through the statehouse? Because you slept through the election."
"We need you to take this seriously because our democracy is at stake, and it's at stake right here in Virginia."
The reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.
"With respect to this issue of whether gays and lesbians should be able to get married, I've spoken about this recently. As I said, you know, my feelings about this are constantly evolving. I struggle with this."
"So, we've got a lot of work to do, not only on ending discrimination; we've got a lot of work to do to live up to the ideals on which we were founded and to preserve the American dream in our time for everybody, whether they're gay or straight or lesbian or transgender."
"What you saw was the people of New York having a debate, talking through these issues. It was contentious, it was emotional, but ultimately they made a decision to recognize civil marriages. And I think that's exactly how things should work."
"The American people are by your side. We're going to stay there until every home is repaired, until every neighborhood is rebuilt, until every business is back on its feet. That's my commitment and that's the American people's commitment."
"...And all of this being done without any demonstrable economic, or actuarial or plain, common-sense rationale. It frustrates, and it's certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple of months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents."
"That was just a - a example of a new senator, you know, making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country."
"Since my administration took office, we have removed nearly 100,000 troops and ended our combat mission in Iraq. We've refocused on the war against al-Qaida and subjected its leadership to relentless pressure. We are pursuing a new strategy that finally devotes the resources we need in the fight against extremism in Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"Now, these are the guys that build serious stuff: concrete blocks, bricks - for walls that are thick, difficult to move and can stop anything in their path. Sort of like the way I feel about Congress sometimes."
"Thousands of small business owners across America had been waiting for months for this bill to pass, for the loans and tax cuts they've badly needed to grow their businesses and hire new employees. Unfortunately, it was held up all summer by a partisan minority until a few courageous Republican senators put politics aside."
I'm here because somebody marched.
"So don't tell me I don't have a claim on Selma, Alabama. Don't tell me I'm not coming home when I come to Selma, Alabama. I'm here because somebody marched for our freedom. I'm here because yall sacrificed for me. I stand on the shoulders of that."
"I have enormous respect for John McCain, but I think he is flat wrong on this issue. And I think he's been wrong for some time."
"The fact is, is that I opposed this war from the start so you are about 4 1/2 years late."
"And I think John, the fact is, is that I opposed this war from the start. So you are about 4 1/2 years late on leadership on this issue. And, you know, I think it's important not to play politics on something that is as critical and as difficult as this."
"My belief is that most families want healthcare, but they can't afford it."
"Yes, I actually did know -- people have been doing these genealogical..."
"Most families want health care, but they can't afford it."
"Hi, guys, this is one of the most fun events on my schedule. What schedule, what I was told, we don't have a firm, set agenda."
I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.
I would reject and denounce --
"During difficult times, during moments of tragedy, the American people come together. We may argue, we may differ, but we are all Americans. And one of the principles of this great country is that during times of need, we are all in it together. And it doesn't matter whether we are Democratic or Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, native-American. We are there for each other at moments of need."
"We can have legitimate disagreements, but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians. And we will hunt them down. But to the broader Muslim world, what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship."
"Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is right for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people and that instead it's time to return to the negotiating table. It's going to be difficult. It's going to take time."
"They are a terrorist organization that we should not negotiate with them unless they recognize Israel, renounce violence and unless they are willing to abide by previous accords between the Palestinians and the Israelis."
The cause of peace in the Middle East is important to the United States and our national interests. It's important to me personally. And it is important to Arabs and Jews. It is important to Christians and Muslims and Jews all around the world. And the charge that Senator Mitchell has is to engage vigorously and consistently in order for us to achieve genuine progress.
You know...
... I've been giving some...
You get some nice stuff. Here's the general rule. I give nicer stuff than I get.
Absolutely.
"Oh, come on. Please. You know..."
"You know, it's like Mother's Day and Father's Day."
You know? You can count (ph)...
But -- but that...
That principle applies generally.
Where did you get this nice little...
"What I'm hoping to accomplish today is for everybody to focus not just on where we differ, but focus on where we agree."
"Oh, no, no, no, no. Let me -- and this is an example of where we've got to get our facts straight."
", PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES Good afternoon, everybody. Please be seated. Dobry den. After many meetings around the world, I am delighted to welcome my friend and partner, President Medvedev, to the White House. This is also an opportunity to return the wonderful hospitality that the president, Mrs. Medvedeva, and the Russian people showed me and my family during our visit to Moscow one year ago. Michelle and I enjoyed a wonderful evening at the president's home. Our daughters will never forget having tea in the winter garden of the Kremlin. And, Mr. President, I hope you'll remember having a burger at Ray's Hell Burger today. We just concluded some excellent discussions, discussions that would have been unlikely just 17 months ago. As we've both said before, when I came into office, the relationship between the United States and Russia had drifted, perhaps to its lowest point since the Cold War. There was too much mistrust and too little real work on issues of common concern. That did not serve the interests of either country or the world. Indeed, I firmly believe that America's most significant national security interests and priorities could be advanced most effectively through cooperation, not an adversarial relationship with Russia. That's why I committed to resetting the relationship between our two nations. And in President Medvedev, I've found a solid and reliable partner. We listen to one another, and we speak candidly. So, Mr. President, I am very grateful for your leadership and your partnership. By any measure, we have made significant progress and achieved concrete results. Together, we negotiated and signed the historic New START Treaty, committing our nations to significant reductions in deployed nuclear weapons. Today, we reaffirmed our commitment to work to ratify this treaty as soon as possible so it can enter into force and set the stage for further cuts and cooperation. Together, we've strengthened the global nonproliferation regime, so that as we meet our obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, other nations meet theirs and are held accountable if they don't. Along with our international partners, we passed and are enforcing new U.N. sanctions against North Korea. We offered Iran the prospect of a better future, and when they refused, we joined with Russia and our partners on the Security Council to impose the toughest sanctions ever faced by the government of Iran. Together, our nations have deepened our cooperation against violent extremism, as terrorists threaten both our people, be it in Times Square or in Moscow. And today, we've agreed to expand our cooperation on intelligence and counter terrorism. Russian transit routes now play a vital role in supplying American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. And to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons, we came together at our nuclear security summit, where our two nations made numerous commitments, including agreeing to eliminate enough plutonium for about 17,000nuclear weapons. Together, we've coordinated our efforts to strengthen the global economic recovery through the G-20, work that we will continue in Toronto this weekend. And today we agreed to continue closely to coordinate our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts following the tragic outbreak of ethnic violence in Kyrgyzstan. Our two countries continue to disagree on certain issues, such as Georgia, and we addressed those differences candidly. But by moving forward in areas where we do agree, we have succeeded in resetting our relationship, which benefits regional and global security. This includes, I would note, a change in the attitudes among the Russian people, who today have a far more favorable view of the United States, and that in turn creates more space for additional partnership. Indeed, this has been the real focus of our work today and of President Medvedev's visit, not simply resetting our relationship, but also broadening it, because 20 years after the end of the Cold War, the U.S.-Russian relationship has to be about more than just security and arms control. It has to be about our shared prosperity and what we can build together. That's why we created the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission during my visit to Moscow last year to forge new partnerships, not just between governments, but between our businesses, our peoples, and our societies. And today, we agreed to forge new cooperation across a whole range of areas. In particular, we're expanding trade and commerce. We agreed to deepen our collaboration on energy efficiency and clean-energy technologies. And this afternoon, President Medvedev and I will join American and Russian business leaders as they move forward with a series of major trade and investment deals that will create jobs for Americans and Russians across many sectors, from aerospace and automotive engineering to the financial sector and high technology. Consistent with my administration's national export initiative, this includes the sale of 50 Boeing aircraft worth $4 billion that could add up to 44,000 new jobs in the American aerospace industry. To deepen Russia's integration into the global economy, I reaffirmed our strong commitment to Russia's ascension to the World Trade Organization. Today, we've reached an agreement that will allow the United States to begin exporting our poultry products to Russia once again. And I want to thank President Medvedev and his team for resolving this issue, which is of such importance to American business and which sends an important signal about Russia's seriousness about achieving membership in the WTO. Therefore, I told President Medvedev that our teams should accelerate their efforts to work together to complete this process in the very near future. Russia belongs in the WTO. That's good for Russia, it's good for America, and it's good for the world economy. I appreciated very much the opportunity to hear President Medvedev's vision for modernization in Russia, especially high-tech innovation as a personal passion of the president. And during his visit to Silicon Valley this week, he visited the headquarter of Twitters (sic), where he opened his own account. I have one, as well, so we may be able to finally throw away those red phones that have been sitting around for so long."
"I think we can all agree, this is a good day for America. Our country has kept its commitment to see that justice is done. The world is safer. It is a better place because of the death of Osama bin Laden."
A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties.
The economy is getting stronger.
America thrives when we build things better than the rest of the world. I want us to make stuff here and sell it over there. I don't want the stuff made over there and selling it over here.
"There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago, I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. And so I just want to wish, sweetie, you, happy anniversary and let you know a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people."
"As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy in our second debate. I felt really well rested after the nice long nap I had in the first debate."
"You know what, Michelle is always my best advisor, my toughest critic. She and I have been through this together."
"We make turn down the invitation to this or that or the other just because we're trying to carve out family time. And I think that's sometimes interpreted as me not wanting to, you know, be out there slapping backs and wheeling and dealing. I think it really has more to do with just the stage we are in our lives."
I think we were campaigning in Iowa.
Because I love my wife.
"Republicans in Congress have two choices here. They can act responsibly, and pay America's bills, or they can act irresponsibly and put America through another economic crisis. But they will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy."
"With respect to the -- this truism about me not socializing enough, and patting folks on the back and all that stuff, most people who know me know I -- I'm a pretty friendly guy. And I like a good party."
"I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear. That I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully."
That I will faithfully execute.
The office of president of the United States.
And will to the best of my ability.
"Preserve, protect and defend -"
The Constitution of the United States.
"So, help me, God."
"Thank you, Mr. Chief justice. Thank you so much."
"I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear."
That I will faithfully execute.
The office of president of the United States.
"And will, to the best of my ability."
"Preserve, protect and defend."
The Constitution of the United States.
So help me God.
"Thank you, Mr. Chief justice. Thank you so much."
"We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms."
"Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence, they deserve a simple vote."
"He is a personal hero, but I don't think I'm unique in that regard. I think he's a hero for the world, and if and when he passes from this place, one thing I think we'll all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages."
"For an African-American, an African-American president to be able to visit this site, I think gives me even greater motivation in terms of defense of human rights around the world."
"Some of the funding comes from rolling back a temporary increase in food stamp benefits or SNAP as it's now called, starting in the fall of 2013."
"I know a number of members of Congress have expressed concerns about this offset being included in the bill, and I'm committed to working with them to restore these funds in the future."
"Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody please have a seat. Have a seat. Welcome to the White House, everybody. And let me begin by thanking Troy and sharing his remarkable story. I could not be more inspired by, you know, what he's accomplished and can't wait to see what he's going to accomplish in the future. My wife -- it's hard to speak after her."
"-- just keep that in mind. Now, we are here for one purpose, we want to make sure more young people have the chance to earn a higher education. And in the 21st century economy we all understand it's never been more important. The good news is that our economy is steadily growing and strengthening after the worst recession in a generation. So we've created more than 8 million new jobs, manufacturing is growing led by a booming auto industry. Thanks to some key public investments in advances like affordable energy and, you know, research and development, what we've seen is not only an energy revolution in this country that bodes well for our future, but in areas like health care for example we've slowed the growth of health care costs in ways that a lot of people wouldn't have anticipated as recently as five or 10 years ago. So there are a lot of good things going on in the economy. And businesses are starting to invest. In fact, what we're seeing are businesses overseas starting to say instead of outsourcing let's source back into the U.S. All that bodes well for our future. Here's the thing though, we don't grow just for the sake of growth. We grow so that it translates into a growing middle class, people getting jobs, people being able to support their families and people being able to pass something on to the next generation. We want to restore the essential promise of opportunity and upward mobility that's at the heart of America. The notion that if you work hard, you can get ahead. You can improve your situation in life. You can make something of yourself. That the same essential story Troy so eloquently told about himself. And the fact is it's been getting harder to do that for a lot of people. It is harder for folks to start in one place and move up that ladder. And that was true long before the recession hit. And that's why I've said that in 2014 we have to consider this a year of action, not just to grow the economy, not just to increase GDP, not just to make sure that corporations are profitable and the stock market's doing well and the financial system is stable. We've also got to make sure that that growth is broad based and everybody has a chance to access that growth and take advantage of it. We've got to make sure that we're creating new jobs and that the wages and benefits that go along with those jobs can support a family. We have to make sure that there are new ladders of opportunity in the middle class and that those ladders, the rungs on those ladders are solid and accessible for more people. Now, I'm going to be working with Congress where I can to accomplish this. But I'm also going to act on my own if Congress is deadlocked. I've got a pen to take executive actions where Congress won't. And I've got a telephone to rally folks around the country on this mission. And today is a great example of how without a whole bunch of new legislation we can advance this agenda. We've got philanthropists and business leaders here. We've got leaders of innovative non for profits, we've got college presidents from state universities and historically black colleges to Ivy League universities and community colleges. And today more than 100 colleges and 40 organizations are announcing new commitments to help more young people not only go to but graduate from college. And that's an extraordinary accomplishment. And we didn't pass a bill to do it. Everybody here is participating, I believe, because you know that college graduation has never been more valuable than it is today. Unemployment for Americans with a college degree is more than a third lower than the national average, incomes twice as high as those without a high school diploma. College is not the only path to success. We've got to make sure that more Americans of all age are getting the skills that they need to access the jobs that are out there right now. But more than ever a college degree is the surest path to a stable middle class life. And higher education speaks to something more than that. The premise that we're all created equal is the opening line in our American story, and we don't promise equal outcomes. We strive to deliver equal opportunity. The idea that success does not depend on being born in a wealth of privilege, depends on effort and merit."
"I know the press likes to focus on the body language and he's got that kind of slouch, looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom."
"Love you, sweetie. You're great."
"I trust them to make good decisions. And the second thing is I've got men with guns following them around all the time. So, that kind of makes me a little less nervous about --"
This is the main reason I ran for re-election.
I knew it was coming. I said let me just project out. I'm going to have them covered for most of high school.
"Some of you may have seen the very attractive sweaters that I purchased for my daughters. They have not worn them yet. So, if they're listening, make me feel good. Just wear it one time."
"Thank you very much, everybody."
"Today, our family will join millions across the country celebrating the birth of Jesus -- the birth not just a baby in a manger but a message that has changed the world, to reach out to the sick, the hungry, the troubled, and above all else, to love one another as we would be loved ourselves."
"In just a few days, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over. Our longest war will come to a responsible end. And that gives us an opportunity to step back and reflect upon all that these families have given us. We're able to gather with family and friends because our troops are willing to hug theirs good-bye, and step forward to serve. After a long day, with he can come home because they're willing to leave their families and deploy. We can celebrate the holidays because they're willing to miss their own."
"So, merry Christmas, everybody. May God bless you all and we wish you and your family a happy and healthy 2015."
"We just saw the Ferguson report come out. I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident. I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down. And individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that of, you know, they are protecting and serving all people and not just some."
The United States will not be imprisoned by the past. We're looking to the future and the policies that improve the lives of the Cuban people. And advance the interests of cooperation in the hemisphere. Now this shift in U.S. policy represents a turning point for our entire region.
"Hello Oregon. Wow. Who arrange this thing? Every time I come to Oregon this is what it looks like. Yeah, the -- it never rains in Oregon doesn't it. Never."
Our objective is clear. We will degrade and ultimately destroy
"You know, one of the pleasures of being president is scouting out places that you want to come back to, where you don't have to spend all your time in a conference room. The setting is breath-taking. Our German friends have been absolutely wonderful, and the success of this summit is a tribute their outstanding work. G7 represents some of the largest economies in the world, but in our G7 partners, the United States also embraces some of our strongest allies and closest friends in the world, so even as we work to promote the growth that creates jobs and opportunity, we're also here to stand up for the fundamental principles that we share as democracies for freedom, for peace, for the right of nations and peoples to decide their own destiny, for universal human rights and the dignity of every human being, and I'm pleased that here in Krun, we showed that on the most pressing global challenges, America and our allies stand united. We agree that the best way to sustain the global economic recovery is by focusing on jobs and growth. That's what I'm focused on in the United States. On Friday we learned that our economy created another 280,000 jobs in May, the strongest month of the year so far, and more than three million new jobs over the past year, nearly the fastest pace in over a decade. We've now seen five straight years of private sector job growth, 12.6 million new jobs created, the longest streak on record. The unemployment is near its lowest level in seven years. Wages for American workers continue to rise, and since I took office, the United States has cut our deficit by two-thirds, so in the global economy, America is a major source of strength. At the same time, we recognize that the global economy, while growing, is still not performing at its full potential, and we agreed on a number of necessary steps. Here in Europe, we support efforts to find a path that enables Greece to carry out key reforms and return to growth within a strong, stable, and growing Eurozone. I updated my partners on our effort with Congress to fast trade promotion authority so we can move ahead with TPP in the Asia Pacific region and TTIP here in Europe. Agreements with high standards to protect workers, public safety and the environment. We continue to make progress toward a strong global climate agreement this year in Paris. All the G7 countries have now put forward our post-2020 targets for reducing carbon emissions and will continue to urge other significant emitters to do so as well. We'll continue to meet our climate finance commitments to help developing countries to transition to low-carbon growth. As we've done in the US, the G7 agreed on the need to integrate climate risks into development assistance and investment programs across the board, and to increase access to risk insurance to help developing countries respond to and recover from climate-related disasters, and building on the Power Africa initiative I launched two years ago, the G7 will work to mobilize more financing for clean energy projects in Africa. With respect to security, the G7 remains strongly united in support for Ukraine. We'll continue to provide economic support and technical assistance that Ukraine needs as it moves ahead on critical reforms to transform its economy and strengthen its democracy. As we've seen again in recent days, Russian forces continue to operate in Eastern Ukraine, violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Now, this is now the second year in a row that the G7 has met without Russia, another example of Russia's isolation, and every member of the G7 continues to maintain sanctions on Russia for its aggression against Ukraine. Now, it's important to recognize the Russian economy has been seriously weakened. The Ruble and foreign investment are down. Inflation is up. The Russian Central Bank has lost more than $150 billion in reserves. Russian banks and firms are virtually locked out of the international markets. Russian energy companies are struggling to import the services and technologies they need for complex energy projects. Russian defense firms have been cut off from key technologies. Russia is in deep recession, so Russia's actions in Ukraine are hurting Russia and hurting the Russian people. Here at the G7, we agreed that even as we will continue to seek a diplomatic solution, sanctions against Russia will remain in place so long as Russia continues to violate its obligations under the Minsk Agreements. Our European partners reaffirmed that they will maintain sanctions on Russia until the Minsk agreements are fully implemented, which means extending the EU's existing sectorial sanctions beyond July, and the G7 is making it clear that if necessary, we stand ready to impose additional significant sanctions against Russia. Beyond Europe, we discussed the negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, and we remain united heading into the final stages of the talks. Iran has a historic opportunity to resolve the international community's concerns about its nuclear program, and we agreed that Iran needs to seize that opportunity. Our discussions with Prime Minister Al-Abadi of Iraq, President Caid Essebsi of Tunisia and President Buhari of Nigeria, were a chance to address the threats of ISIL and Boko Haram. The G7 countries, therefore, agreed to work together and with our partners to further coordinate our counter-terrorism efforts. As many of the world's leading partners in global development joined by leaders of Ethiopia, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and the African Union, we discussed how to maximize the impact of our development partnerships. We agreed to continue our landmark initiative to promote food security and nutrition, part of our effort to lift 500 million people into developing countries out of hunger and malnutrition by 2030. We'll continue to work with our partners in West Africa to get ebola cases down to zero, and as part of our global health security agenda, I'm pleased that the G7 made a major commitment to help 60 countries over the next five years achieve specific targets to better prevent, detect, and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics. And, finally, I want to commend Chancellor Merkel for ensuring that this summit included a focus on expanding educational and economic opportunities for women and girls. The G7 committed to expanding career training for women in our own countries and to increase technical and vocational training in developing countries which will help all of our nations prosper. So, again, I want to thank Angela and the People of Germany for their extraordinary hospitality. I leave here confident that when it comes to the key challenges of our time, America and our closest allies stand shoulder-to-shoulder, so with that, I will take some questions, and I will start off with Jeff Mason of Reuters."
To say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families and their communities doesn't say enough to convey the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feel.
"The legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives, you know, that casts a long shadow, and that's still part of our DNA that's passed on. It -- we're not cured of it."
"Racism, we are not cured of it."
"And it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public. That's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It's not just a matter of overt discrimination. We have -- societies don't, overnight, completely erase everything that happened two to three hundred years prior."
